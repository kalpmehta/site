I'm a technology leader with a growing focus on the practical application of AI, large language models (LLMs), and blockchain in enterprise and commerce environments. With a strong foundation in platforms like Adobe Commerce (Cloud Service), Magento, AEM, and AEP—as well as tools like App Builder, API Mesh, and Commerce Optimizer—I’ve helped deliver scalable solutions for billion-dollar revenue clients, driving measurable impact across KPIs like performance, conversion, and operational efficiency.

My recent work has involved exploring how AI and LLMs can enhance user experiences, automate workflows, and surface insights that guide smarter product decisions. I’m also actively evaluating the role of blockchain in secure, transparent digital ecosystems. With experience leading cross-functional teams, aligning stakeholders, and delivering results in high-stakes environments, I’m now focused on stepping into senior roles where I can bridge emerging technologies with real business value—driving innovation with purpose and precision.
