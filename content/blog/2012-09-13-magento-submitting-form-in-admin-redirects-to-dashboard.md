When trying to submit a form which is created in admin, it redirects to dashboard no matter how much you try. I faced this problem and tried many things but without any luck. Everything was running, for file upload I had enctype=‚Äùmultipart/form-data‚Äù in form, checked the form action through firebug and run it directly in browser URL which was also going good. After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.

Finally, got one forum where I found the solution to this problem. In Magento, when submitting the form, you need to have one extra hidden field, with name ‚Äúform_key‚Äù which should have form‚Äôs key value from session. Here is the line of code, which helped me in posting form successfully.

{{< highlight php "style=emacs" >}}<input name="form_key" type="hidden" value="<?php echo Mage::getSingleton('core/session')->getFormKey() ?>‚Äù /> {{< /highlight >}}</p>
<p>Hope this helps some frustrated mind üôÇ</p>
