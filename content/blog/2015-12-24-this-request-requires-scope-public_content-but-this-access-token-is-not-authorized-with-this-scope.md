***This request requires scope=public_content, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=public_content to be granted this permissions***

If you are getting this error while using Instagram API in Sandbox mode, all you need to do is authorize the scope by going to the below URL. Donâ€™t forget to replace YOUR-CLIENT-ID with your Instagram client ID and YOUR-REDIRECT-URI with your valid redirect URI.

[https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&amp;redirect_uri=YOUR-REDIRECT-URI&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=public_content](https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=YOUR-REDIRECT-URI&response_type=code&scope=public_content)

You may also need to authorize **basic**, **comments**, **follower_list**, **likes** or/and **relationships** if you are getting any of the below errors.

***This request requires scope=comments, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=comments to be granted this permissions***

***This request requires scope=follower_list, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=follower_list to be granted this permissions***

***This request requires scope=likes, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=likes to be granted this permissions***

***This request requires scope=relationships, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=relationships to be granted this permissions***

To authorize ALL the above scopes at once use below link replacing your client ID and redirect URI:

[https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&amp;redirect_uri=YOUR-REDIRECT-URI&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=basic+comments+follower_list+likes+relationships+public_content](https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=YOUR-REDIRECT-URI&response_type=code&scope=basic+comments+follower_list+likes+relationships+public_content)
