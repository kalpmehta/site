Many of you already know, I am selected this year as a Magento Master 2020 in the Makers category. I am very grateful to all the people who encouraged and believed in me during this roller-coaster journey. I am thankful to Ben Marks, Sherrie Rohde and the entire Magento, an Adobe company team who had to put lot of efforts to analyze all the contributors across many categories and narrow it down to the final 20 top contributors in the community.
