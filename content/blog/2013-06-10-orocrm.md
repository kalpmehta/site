OroCRM is an open-source Client Relationship Management tool founded in 2012 by Yoav Kutner, previous CTO and co-founder of Magento AND Jary Carter, former VP of Sales and Channel of Magento. Dima Soroka, who was Lead Architect for Magento is the VP of Engineering in Oro Inc. With such industry leaders, OroCRM is believed to be the next big CRM for many e-commerce frameworks. Personally I like this CRM because there are no good CRM available in PHP which can seamlessly integrate with Magento and offer flexibility that clients need. OroCRM is aimed to deal with these issues where it will offer flexible needs, reporting and marketing tools for multi-channel commerce.

Currently it’s in development stage, but they made the code available so that users can check out and use the application already. They highly recommend to not use it yet on production. OroCRM is created on it’s own Oro Platform, Business Application Platform (BAP). This Platform includes features like Navigation Menus, Form auto-save, Data Audit, Data Grid, Users, Groups and ACL, REST and SOAP APIs and Advanced Search. These are the foundation of Oro Platform which reduces development time in business application development.

It is licensed under open source license (OSL 3.0), giving the users permission to download and modify the code as per their wish. You can download Oro Platform and CRM from Github:
