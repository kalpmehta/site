It is always required for the customer to track their order. The shipping carriers can be anything: Aramex, Bluedart, DHL, First Flight, Federal Express, etc.. Navigate to My Account and place a button in My Orders section there “Track Order”. Paste the code below to link it to tracking popup that you can also see in backend Shipments area.

<?php if($_order->hasShipments()) { 
 $show = true;  
 foreach($_order->getTracksCollection() as $k=>$v) {  
 if($v[‘carrier_code’] == ‘custom’ || $v[‘carrier_code’] == ”)  
 $show = false;  
 }  
 if($show) {?>  
 <span class="separator2"> </span>
