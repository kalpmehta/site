If you want your Magento website to show in maintenance mode, you will have to do two things.

1\. Create a file name **maintenance.flag** in your magento root directory. Contents under this file doesnâ€™t matter, you can keep it empty.  
2\. Change the maintenance file (located in **magento root -> errors -> default** directory) to show proper message when user visits your website.
