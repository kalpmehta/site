Magento Imagine 2019 is just 2 weeks away, I cannot wait any longer now! This year would be crazy for me, as I am participating in Contribution Days as a Maintainer that happens on Saturday and Sunday before the conference, and also hosting a Dev Exchange table after the conference on Wednesday. Also, this would be my first Imagine from agency side, so things would be different.

As many of you know, I have advocated Magento Security for quite a while now. From submitting core security bugs to adding an entire Security topic in the Magento 2 Professional Developer Plus certification, I realized there is many more things to do. This year I am going to host Dev Exchange where I will share my security ideas and also get ideas and feedback from the community. One very important thing that we would address this year is third-party extensions security. Pablo Benitez, CTO at eBizmarts, will join me bringing in business perspective when talking about third-party extension security. Talesh Seeparsan will bring his past Dev Exchange experiences on security and help us in guiding and noting down all the ideas and feedback that we would discuss with all the participants.

If you are coming to Magento Imagine and would stay little late on Wednesday, please stop by our Dev Exchange table and join the conversation. Here is the topic and details we submitted for Magento Imagine Dev Exchange 2019:

> Do you have ideas to make [\#Magento](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Magento?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) more secure? Are you interested in participating on security-related discussion at [\#MagentoImagine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagentoImagine?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)? Then please vote/comment here (deadline 4/26) and stop by our DevExchange table <https://t.co/ZNoLSwScrH>. cc/ [@_Talesh](https://twitter.com/_Talesh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) @centerax [@foomanNZ](https://twitter.com/FoomanNZ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [@ext_dn](https://twitter.com/ext_dn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/eGS0vF8P6R](https://t.co/eGS0vF8P6R)

**Make Magento more secure**

<span class="s1">It’s 2019 and security is a top priority of Magento/Adobe. Every participant in the ecosystem has their part to play to keep merchant stores secure. Let us discuss current low hanging fruits in the ecosystem and share strategies/tools for managing them effectively. For each item we will outline the topic and it’s security shortcomings then begin a deeper investigation into solutions with knowledge and idea sharing before moving to the next one. This is a co-hosted panel: Kalpesh Mehta leading with deep technical security experience and Pablo Benitez bringing the experience and technical/business concerns from an extension developer for a fully rounded conversation. Special thanks to Talesh Seeparsan and Kristof Ringleff for bringing their past Dev Exchange experience around extension security.</span>

<span class="s3">1.) Extension Developers write secure code.</span>

<span class="s3">With the proactive and nimble approach Magento has taken to core security, many time agencies and merchants find external 3rd party extensions makers have not put in as much effort. How can we encourage their developers to take a more secure coding approach? Can Magento community maintain secure coding practices document like [<span class="s5">technical guidelines, security</span>](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/coding-standards/technical-guidelines.html#15-security)? Validate code using a tool like PHP CodeSniffer ? What solutions already exist that we can rely on? What processes already exist that we can implement?</span>

2.) Better ways to report vulnerabilities on a merchant’s site

<span class="s3">Magento has a bug bounty program to report vulnerabilities in their code and websites. If a user or security researcher finds vulnerabilities in some Magento powered web store, not owned by Magento – an Adobe company, how can they reach out to the right person on the merchant’s team? How to pass the information given the sensitive nature of the issue? Should Magento accept [<span class="s6">security.txt standard</span>](https://securitytxt.org/)?</span>

<span class="s3">3.) Code review in community submitted Pull Requests</span>

<span class="s3">Is Magento doing security code review when someone submits a PR to core code? What to check for when doing code reviews to identify security risks?  
</span>

<span class="s3">4.) Add Security topics in Developer certifications</span>

<span class="s3">Magento has already included Security topic in Magento 2 Professional Developer Plus exam. Can we ask Magento to include Security in Associate as well as Developer exam? Can it help developers learn security best practices?  
</span>

<span class="s1">All recommendations and suggestions will be documented and shared with the Magento security team and the community afterwards. Remember to keep the privacy of your client intact while discussing vulnerabilities and attacks.</span>
