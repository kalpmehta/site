      <description>&lt;p&gt;When trying to submit a form which is created in admin, it redirects to dashboard no matter how much you try. I faced this problem and tried many things but without any luck. Everything was running, for file upload I had enctype=”multipart/form-data” in form, checked the form action through firebug and run it directly in browser URL which was also going good. After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I faced this problem and tried many things but without any luck. Everything was running, for file upload I had enctype=”multipart/form-data” in form, checked the form action through firebug and run it directly in browser URL which was also going good. After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.</p>
<p>Finally, got one forum where I found the solution to this problem. In Magento, when submitting the form, you need to have one extra hidden field, with name “form_key” which should have form’s key value from session. Here is the line of code, which helped me in posting form successfully.</p>
<p>



<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#666">&lt;</span>input name<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">&#34;form_key&#34;</span> type<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">&#34;hidden&#34;</span> value<span style="color:#666">=</span><span style="color:#b44">&#34;&lt;?php echo Mage::getSingleton(&#39;core/session&#39;)-&gt;getFormKey() ?&gt;” /&gt; 
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
