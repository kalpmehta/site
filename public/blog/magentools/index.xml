<p>If you have hundreds/thousands of products in your store and want to pin it on Pinterest it becomes very difficult, as Pinterest don’t provide multiple pinning of images. One by one pinning images is a nightmare if you have lots of products. There is also no official Pinterest API which can allow you to auto-pin your images through some kind of API.</p>
<p>If you are using Magento as your e-commerce framework, there’s a good news for you! There is an extension available at Magentools.com which gives you ability to auto-pin hundreds of product images in just one click! Other options includes to pin image with your Product Name, SKU and Price along with your product link on your website. This extension, called as Pinterest Auto Pin multiple images plugin acts as a bridge between your Magento store and Pinterest. In your Magento admin panel’s “Manage Products” screen, you can see the option Pin To Board which loads all your Pinterest boards you want the product images to pin into! It also allows you to pin the individual product image pin when you create new product / edit existing product, by clicking on the tab “MagenTools” and selecting your desired Pinterest Board before saving the product.</p>
<p>It’s the must-have extension for the e-Commerce company which is more focused into marketing their products online and want more potential customers.
