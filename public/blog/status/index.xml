      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get all the products with status equal to enabled/disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using Flat Catalog in Magento, you will not get disabled products by this filter as in flat table all the products are only enabled one. You can check if your Magento website uses flat catalog or not by going here:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Admin &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Configuration &amp;gt; Catalog section &amp;gt; Catalog &amp;gt; Frontend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;em&gt;Use Flat Catalog Category&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Use Flat Catalog Product&lt;/em&gt;, if they are &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; it means you are using flat catalog, if they are &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; it means you are NOT using flat catalog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>If you are using Flat Catalog in Magento, you will not get disabled products by this filter as in flat table all the products are only enabled one. You can check if your Magento website uses flat catalog or not by going here:<br>
<em>Admin &gt; System &gt; Configuration &gt; Catalog section &gt; Catalog &gt; Frontend</em></p>
<p>Check <em>Use Flat Catalog Category</em> and <em>Use Flat Catalog Product</em>, if they are <em>Yes</em> it means you are using flat catalog, if they are <em>No</em> it means you are NOT using flat catalog.</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have flat catalog enabled and you want to filter all the products with status equal to disabled, you can use below code:</p>




<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#b8860b">$products</span> <span style="color:#666">=</span> Mage<span style="color:#666">::</span><span style="color:#b44">getModel</span>(‘catalog<span style="color:#666">/</span>category’)<span style="color:#666">-&gt;</span><span style="color:#b44">load</span>(<span style="color:#b8860b">$category_id</span>)  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#666">-&gt;</span><span style="color:#b44">getProductCollection</span>()  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#666">-&gt;</span><span style="color:#b44">addAttributeToSelect</span>(‘<span style="color:#666">*</span>’) <span style="color:#080;font-style:italic">//whatever attributes you want to get here  
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"></span><span style="color:#666">-&gt;</span><span style="color:#b44">addAttributeToFilter</span>(  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> ‘status’,  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">array</span>(‘eq’ <span style="color:#666">=&gt;</span> Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Status<span style="color:#666">::</span><span style="color:#b44">STATUS_DISABLED</span>)  
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#080;font-style:italic">//replace DISABLED to ENABLED for products with status enabled  
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#080;font-style:italic"></span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>

      <title>Magento: Difference between order states and statuses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/magento-difference-between-order-states-and-statuses/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are building website in Magento, you may have noticed that there are two columns in &lt;em&gt;sales_flat_order&lt;/em&gt; table which are confusing. These are &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;status&lt;/strong&gt;. You might think what is the difference between these two, both having same meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is not the case. They both are different. State is used by magento to tell if the order is new, processing, complete, holded, closed, canceled, etc.; while Statuses are the one that YOU would be defining at the backend in System -&amp;gt; Order Statuses. Magento displays order STATUSES and not STATES in the backend order detail page to let you know which status is assigned as per your mapping. Remember, multiple statuses can be mapped with one state, while vice versa is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are building website in Magento, you may have noticed that there are two columns in <em>sales_flat_order</em> table which are confusing. These are <strong>state</strong> and <strong>status</strong>. You might think what is the difference between these two, both having same meaning.</p>
<p>Well, this is not the case. They both are different. State is used by magento to tell if the order is new, processing, complete, holded, closed, canceled, etc.; while Statuses are the one that YOU would be defining at the backend in System -&gt; Order Statuses. Magento displays order STATUSES and not STATES in the backend order detail page to let you know which status is assigned as per your mapping. Remember, multiple statuses can be mapped with one state, while vice versa is not possible.</p>
<p>Consider an example, your customer places an order as Cash on Delivery, you will need something like COD_Pending as the order status so that you know it is not yet paid. Magento will have state <em>new</em> for this, which makes you unpredictable of what kind of transaction is this, COD or Prepaid. The STATUS can be anything, as you define, for your understanding; while STATE is something which Magento needs to understand, internally.</p>
<p>In short, Magento uses order state internally for processing order, whereas order status are used by store owners to understand the exact order flow where one state can be assigned to multiple statuses.</p>
<p>To understand this in detail, have a look at <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/2_-_magento_concepts_and_architecture/order_management">this</a><br>
Hope it helps!</p>
