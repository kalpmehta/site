<p>While modifying Aheadworks follow up extension on our store to meet our specific requirements, I discovered multiple security vulnerabilities in the extension. As the vulnerabilities were pretty serious, I immediately sent my discoveries to Magento team which they promptly sent to Aheadworks team. Aheadworks was quick enough to fix the vulnerabilities and rolled out the patches.</p>
<p>Link of the extension in Magento Marketplace:<br>
<a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/aheadworks-follow-up-email.html">https://marketplace.magento.com/aheadworks-follow-up-email.html</a><br>
It allows store owners to send automated emails to customers who had abandoned their cart.<br>
<img src="http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fue-2.png" alt="Aheadworks follow up email extension"></p>
<p>All the below vulnerabilities were found in the extension.</p>
<p><strong>1. SQL injection</strong><br>
<strong>2. Directory Traversal vulnerability</strong><br>
<em>Attacker can traverse to any directory on the server. In earlier PHP versions (prior to 5.3.4), attacker can read any file on server including /etc/passwd</em><br>
<strong>3. Unrestricted Directories creation</strong><br>
<em>Attacker can create any number of directories and subdirectories with their desired name wherever web server has permissions</em></p>
<p>I will not disclose any technical details and PoC of the vulnerabilties here to prevent wild exploits on Magento websites having this extension installed.</p>
