<p>It is just incredible that there were 5,900 contributors that Magento can quantify in 2018. I am so proud to be in the top 1% of the contributors who were recognized in the Top 50 contributors list. It is a very difficult job to find who contributed most or whose contributions impacted most given such a large community contributors, but Sherrie Rohde, Magento Community Manager, just excels in that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a side note, there were over 5,900 contributors (that we know of and could quantify) in the Magento Community in 2018. My mind is blown. 5,900?!</p>
<p>Literally the best community that exists, not that I&rsquo;m biased. ðŸ§¡</p>

<p>For all those contributors who couldnâ€™t make it to the top 50 list, here is a thankful quote by Sherri with an orange heart!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much to these 50, but also to the rest of you who continue to help this community in ways that are unique and central to you! Contributing isn&rsquo;t about being recognized, but recognizing is one small way that we can thank you. ðŸ§¡ <a href="https://t.co/65xLtv4zEI">https://t.co/65xLtv4zEI</a></p>
