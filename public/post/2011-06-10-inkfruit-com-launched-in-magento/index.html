<meta name="description" content="After so much of hard work and less time to complete, finally we launched our old core PHP website in Magento.
At beginning, the task was the tough nut to crack, but then it was more interesting and honestly we loved it.
Magento is really far more different and complex than other frameworks, cms and commerce softwares.
It has got the power to make a giant eCommerce website but beware, it is also too slow and resouce-hungry.
It has everything you want during development, you just need to know from where and how to get and use it." />

It has everything you want during development, you just need to know from where and how to get and use it.</p>
<p>There were many things we learned through the process.</p>
<p>It has everything the magento website can have, from core module rewrites to EAV module.</p>
<p>Plenty of customization but no changes in core!</p>
<p>It was really a great experience and things in Magento are far more clear to us now.</p>
