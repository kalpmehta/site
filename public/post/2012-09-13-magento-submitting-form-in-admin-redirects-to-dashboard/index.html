  <p>When trying to submit a form which is created in admin, it redirects to dashboard no matter how much you try. I faced this problem and tried many things but without any luck. Everything was running, for file upload I had enctype=”multipart/form-data” in form, checked the form action through firebug and run it directly in browser URL which was also going good. After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.</p>
<p>Finally, got one forum where I found the solution to this problem. In Magento, when submitting the form, you need to have one extra hidden field, with name “form_key” which should have form’s key value from session. Here is the line of code, which helped me in posting form successfully.</p>
<p>{code type=php}&lt;input name=&ldquo;form_key&rdquo; type=&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; value=&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” /&gt; {/code}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
