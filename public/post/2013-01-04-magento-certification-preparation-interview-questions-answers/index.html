  <p>Hi guys, here is the stuff I collected and created from myriad number of websites/blogs/forums/ magento source codebase during my Magento certification preparation. I have put all the things I found and studied during my preparation in one place, so that other developers who are preparing for the exam can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Credits to all who have contributed these things over the web from where I copied for study purpose. Few credits to me as well as I also have contributed many things in it 🙂 This may contain errors and wrong information and I don’t guarantee it to be completely correct. But this should be a good resource if you want a heads up! Please be aware that you need to go through the study guide and fundamental videos yourself in order to pass this exam.</p>
<p><em>If you are here to prepare for Interview, then I would recommend you to also go through these links:</em><br>
<a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2012/07/19/magento-interview-questions-and-answers/" title="Magento Interview questions and answers">Magento Interview questions and answers</a><br>
<a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2012/01/29/magento-advanced-interview-questions/" title="Magento Advanced Interview questions">Magento Advanced Interview questions/</a></p>
<p>The below stuff alone will definitely not going to help you much in passing the exam. Not to mention, these resource can also be used for Magento interview preparation.</p>
<p>{code type=html}<br>
Magento supports and loads translations in the following order:</p>
<p>– Module Translation CSV in /app/locale<br>
– Theme Translation CSV in /app/design/</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/locale (theme folder translate)<br>
– DB Translation Database (table core_translate) ——-<br>
How many options exist to add a custom translation for any given string?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are three options in Magento to add a custom translation to a text string: module translation, theme translation and inline translation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Module translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Module translations are stored in app/locale/languagecode_COUNTRYCODE/ folder in form of csv files, named as Namespace_Modulename.csv All string in extensions that are inside __() method can be translated this way</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Theme translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Strings can be translated inside your theme, for that you just need to set locale via Magento admin area, then create translate.csv in app/design/frontend/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/locale/ languagecode_COUNTRYCODE and put your translated strings inside this CSV<br>
“My Cart”,”My Basket”<br>
“My Account”,”Account”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Inline translation</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable inline translation you need to log into Admin panel and go to System -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Developer.<br>
You need to select Store view from scope select and enable inline translation for this desired store view there.</p>

<p>Magento uses the Front Controller pattern for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Receiving and processing browser data, transferring it to other system elements;<br>
Defining controller and proper action to perform using routes;<br>
Displaying browser-requested data using blocks, templates and model data.</p>

<p>——-<br>
The layout initialization happens as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instances of the Layout and Layout Update are created.</li>
<li>Layout handles are added according to the $handles argument if passed.</li>
<li>Store layout handle STORE_[store_code] is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if code of current store is en, then layout handle STORE_en is added.</li>
<li>Theme layout handle THEME_[area]_[package]_[layout_theme] is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if the page rendered is for the frontend area, the current theme package name is magebase and theme name for layout is modern, then the layout handle THEME_frontend_magebase_modern is added.</li>
<li>Action layout handle is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if the page rendered is a category detail page, then Magento is executing catalog module’s category controller’s view action. So it will add an action handle catalog_category_view.</li>
<li>All Layout XML files defined for all active modules are loaded</li>
<li>If a layout file named local.xml exists in the current theme’s layout folder, it is loaded last</li>
<li>Layout updates of all added layout handles from the loaded layout XML are merged</li>
<li>Layout updates of all added layout handles from the database are merged</li>
<li>If the $generateXML argument of loadLayout() method is passed as false, the initialization is finished.</li>
<li>The layout update data is refined by removing all blocks and block references defined with the remove tag. (As discussed in Part 1)</li>
<li>If $generateBlocks argument is passed as false, the initialization is finished.</li>
<li>The instances of block classes are created according to the block definitions in the Layout XML</li>
<li>The methods are called with specified arguments on the blocks where action tags are defined. (As discussed in Part 1)<br>
——-</li>
</ol>
<p>A layout should have at least one *output* block. Normally, the root block is the only output block in a layout but there can be multiple output blocks for a single page. In that case, the output of each output block is merged and returned in the response.</p>
<p>The *non-output* blocks are child blocks of output blocks and are normally rendered with the getChildHtml() method. There are also two other methods: getChildChildHtml() and getBlockHtml() also used to render non-output blocks.<br>
——-</p>
<p>Blocks can be instantiated via layout xml (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->dipatch() that does the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Process scheduled cron queue: Magento reads the cron schedule table for jobs that need to be executed this very second and jobs that should have already been executed, i.e. with timestamps in the past, that haven’t expired. The expiry limit is also a parameter, configurable in the admin panel. After all the work, dispatch method calls two generate() and cleanup() methods</p>
<p>Generate tasks schedule: Mage_Cron_Model_Observer-&gt;generate(), this method searches final configuration file for content of <!-- raw HTML omitted --> nodes ($config = Mage::getConfig()-&gt;getNode(‘crontab/jobs’); ), reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;cron_expr&gt; elements to find out when and how often they need to be executed and pulls this data into the cron_schedule table.&lt;/cron_expr&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Cleanup: Mage_Cron_Model_Observer-&gt;cleanup(), this method deletes completed (with ‘success’ status) or missed ($time &lt; $now – $scheduleLifetime, where $scheduleLifetime are set in Magento admin area) jobs from cron_schedule DB table. &mdash;&mdash;- 1. All .xml files are collected into one big simpleXmlElement object 2. First, data is loaded from app/etc/*.xml and then from app/etc/modules/*.xml. Based on the module loaded information, config.xml is loaded from the etc directory of the module. If we load backend to check ACL and build menu elements, adminhtml.xml and system.xml are loaded as well. Configuration data from the database is the last one to load. 3. Any parameters, except the ones stored in app/etc/local.xml, can be overridden in config.xml of a custom module. P.S. Even though Magento provides us with such convenient methods as Mage:: getStoreConfig() and Mage:: getStoreConfigFlag(), we can reach any element of the configuration tree with the help of Mage::getConfig()-&gt;getNode($path, $scope, $scopeCode);</p>

Difference: A Website, a Store and a Store View.</p>
<p>Each websites has its unique customer and order base, base currency and prices.<br>
Stores can be used to define for example different (looking) stores with the same information.<br>
Store Views are mostly used to handle different languages on your website. You will typically have one Store View per language.</p>
<p>———-<br>
Setting And Getting Cookies</p>
<p>To set cookies:</p>
<p>Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;set(‘cookie_name’, ‘cookie_value’, 0); # session cookie<br>
Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;set(‘cookie_name’, ‘cookie_value’, 60); #lasts 60 seconds</p>
<p>To get cookies:</p>
<p>Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;get(‘made_productalerts_stock’);</p>
<p>———-</p>
<p>Sending Transactional E-Mails</p>
<p>$email = Mage::getModel(‘core/email_template’);</p>
<p>$email-&gt;sendTransactional(<br>
‘some_email_template’, // template<br>
array(‘name’ =&gt; ‘Your Company’, ’email’ =&gt; ‘contact@yourcompany.com’), // sender details<br>
‘joe@joebloggs.com’, // recipient email<br>
‘Joe Bloggs’, // recipient name<br>
array(‘customerName’ =&gt; ‘Joe Bloggs’), // merge vars<br>
Mage::app()-&gt;getStore()-&gt;getStoreId() // store id<br>
);</p>
<p>———-<br>
Resizing A Product Image</p>
<p>$helper = Mage::helper(‘catalog/image’);<br>
$helper-&gt;init($product, ‘image’);<br>
$helper-&gt;resize(216, 161);</p>
<p>———-<br>
Adding A Layout Handle From A Controller</p>
<p>If you really need to add a handle to a controller, you need to replace the call to $this-&gt;loadLayout() with:</p>
<p>$update = $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;getUpdate();<br>
$update-&gt;addHandle(‘default’);<br>
$this-&gt;addActionLayoutHandles();<br>
$update-&gt;addHandle(‘your_handle’);<br>
$this-&gt;loadLayoutUpdates();<br>
$this-&gt;generateLayoutXml();<br>
$this-&gt;generateLayoutBlocks();<br>
$this-&gt;_isLayoutLoaded = true;</p>
