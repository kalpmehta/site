      <title>Security.txt Magento module</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-08-02-security-txt-magento-module/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent release of Magento 2.4.0 open source and commerce, you can find a brand new module under vendor/magento/ directory named &lt;strong&gt;module-securitytxt&lt;/strong&gt;. You may find it a small module, but you will amaze to know the importance of that module in terms of the security. Two years ago, I was reading the blog post from Troy Hunt and other reputed people in the security industry about this new file called Security.txt which allows security researchers to report security vulnerabilities to the right people in the organization. I am amazed by this, because of my personal experience in not getting hold of right people in the organization whenever I find any security vulnerability on any website. I found security issues on numerous websites before reading about security.txt, and tried many ways to reach out to the people in the organization in an effort to get a hold of someone who is responsible to fix this. I sent messages to the people working in that organizations via LinkedIn, Twitter DM, tech email addresses I could find from whois, customer service, etc.. But, zero replies!! Of course, who would want to reply to such scary messages about their website right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent release of Magento 2.4.0 open source and commerce, you can find a brand new module under vendor/magento/ directory named <strong>module-securitytxt</strong>. You may find it a small module, but you will amaze to know the importance of that module in terms of the security. Two years ago, I was reading the blog post from Troy Hunt and other reputed people in the security industry about this new file called Security.txt which allows security researchers to report security vulnerabilities to the right people in the organization.

Of course, who would want to reply to such scary messages about their website right?!</p>
<h2 id="securitytxt-to-the-rescue">Security.txt to the rescue</h2>
<p>As soon as I learned about security.txt, I read many articles and checked its official website <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">https://securitytxt.org/</a> to understand how it works. I really liked the concept, and thought to make it available to everyone in the very platform I love, Magento. I built Magento 2 module to allow administrators to input and store all the security contact details and signature in the database, which can be then easily viewed at the standard locations <a href="https://website.com/.well-known/security.txt">https://website.com/.well-known/security.txt</a> and <a href="https://website.com/.well-known/security.txt.sig">https://website.com/.well-known/security.txt.sig</a></p>
<p>Security.txt files have been adopted by many big players in the industry like Google, GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-community">Listen to the community</h2>
<p>Right after building the module and pushing it to my Github <a href="https://github.com/kalpmehta/securitytxt">securitytxt repo</a>, I was gathering feedbacks about this new security standard from the Magento community. I asked many well known people in the community, at various events and Dev Exchange, to understand its pros/cons from other people’s perspective. Unsurprisingly, many were in favor of this. There were some people against having a dedicated module for this, because Magento already has many modules that not every merchants need but they still have to keep it because… it comes out of the box. Totally valid point. However, this is a security module and Magento 2 was already infested with security bugs in the early days and not to mention security bugs that gets introduced via third-party extensions. With the modular approach of the securitytxt, it is very convenient for any merchant to enable and input security contact details and save right from the admin, which hardly takes 2 minutes! I do not know why anyone would want to disable any security module tbh. Before the module, there were hardly any merchants who had uploaded security.txt file on their server, even though the argument was it is the easiest approach so why to introduce a module for that. Ultimately, reward outweighed the risk and it was decided to ship this module in the core bundle.</p>
<p>I presented security.txt’s importance in various meetups last year and gathered feedbacks from the event attendees as well.</p>
<h2 id="securitytxt-in-magento-240">Security.txt in Magento 2.4.0</h2>

<p>Finally after 2 years my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/magento?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#magento</a> community contributed module (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Security?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Security</a>.txt) is available OOTB with today&rsquo;s release of 2.4.0 version!! 🎉</p>
<p>Highly recommended to use it on all your upcoming 2.4 Magento stores.</p>

<p>If you are working as a Magento developer in retail, please make sure you submit security contact details to the security.txt configuration in the admin panel. If you are at an SI/Agency, and responsible to manage your clients’ websites, please submit your company’s security team contact information so all the emails/phone calls come to you. After all, it is a nightmare to know about security vulnerabilities once the website is already compromised.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>It was a broader community and cross-functional team effort at Magento to make this possible. I thank all the people who were very helpful in the entire process – providing positive and constructive feedbacks, improving module by suggesting and making changes to ensure best code quality, introducing unit tests, participants of the meetings with product owners and community engineering team to go through the features, devdocs and release notes article writers, QA and product release team. May be I missed some, I thank them as well. Special thanks to Troy Hunt, Ed Foudil, Oleksii Korsenko, Piotr Kaminski, Smita Verma and Eugene Shakhsuvarov.</p>

      <title>How to pass Magento 2 certification exams</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-21-pass-magento-2-certification-exams/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks, I am getting many requests on how to pass M2 certifications via email, twitter, slack, skype, etc.. I recently passed 5th M2 certification exam and would like to share with all my Magento friends how I prepared for these exams. There is no secret mantra which can help you pass M2 certification tests quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need hands-on experience, that is the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; mandatory requirement. At least an year of experience in Magento 2 will give you good understanding on how everything in it works. If you are the kind of folks who copy and paste the code all the time, you need at least 3 years of Magento 2 experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi folks, I am getting many requests on how to pass M2 certifications via email, twitter, slack, skype, etc.. I recently passed 5th M2 certification exam and would like to share with all my Magento friends how I prepared for these exams. There is no secret mantra which can help you pass M2 certification tests quickly and easily.</p>
<p>You need hands-on experience, that is the <strong>first</strong> mandatory requirement. At least an year of experience in Magento 2 will give you good understanding on how everything in it works. If you are the kind of folks who copy and paste the code all the time, you need at least 3 years of Magento 2 experience.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> in the list is, <a href="https://devdocs.magento.com">Magento DevDocs</a>. No matter what M2 exam you go for, read and understand all the Magento DevDocs articles on it. Being part of the hardest M2 certification test questions writer group, I can assure you, you will not be disappointed if you have prepared DevDocs for your certification exam.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, go prepare SwiftOtter study guides. And prepare it slowly, understand each and every line written in that guide. After completing that, give the SwiftOtter test to know where you stand with your preparation and if you will able to crack the real exam.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, try things practically. Though I understand you might not have luxury of time to test and learn everything practically, try important areas of the exam by writing the code locally and understand the flow of logic.</p>
<p>I may edit this post in the future, but if you have followed these three important things mentioned above, your chances to pass any M2 exam will increase exponentially.</p>

<p>I hosted a table at Dev Exchange around <a href="https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-Imagine-DevExchange-2019/Make-Magento-more-secure/idi-p/127723">Magento security</a>, which was co-hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/centerax">Pablo Benitez</a> from eBizmarts. <a href="https://twitter.com/piotrekkaminski">Piotr Kaminski</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenZurek">Steven Zurek</a> participated from Magento/Adobe’s side. <a href="https://twitter.com/_Talesh">Talesh Seeparsan</a> took all the notes and contributed to the discussion during the talk.

Everyone participated in the discussion and gave their valuable feedback on the topics we discussed, overall it was very productive.</p>
<p>There were 4 main topics we discussed at the table:</p>
<h3 id="1-extension-developers-write-secure-code">1. Extension developers write secure code</h3>
<p><em>With the proactive and nimble approach Magento has taken to core security, many time agencies and merchants find external 3rd party extension makers have not put in as much effort. How can we encourage their developers to take a more secure coding approach? Can Magento community maintain secure coding practices document like <a href="https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/coding-standards/technical-guidelines.html#15-security">technical guidelines, security</a>? Validate code using a tool like PHP CodeSniffer? What solutions already exist that we can rely on? What processes already exist that we can implement?</em></p>
<p><strong>Static Scanners / RIPS:</strong></p>
<p>Third party code checking and code scanning is a complex process. <a href="http://rips-scanner.sourceforge.net/">RIPS</a> work for some paths, they are also working on improving the support. We can add Regular Expressions to the old open source versions as well. However, we have to do lot of work to deal with the false positives because they don’t directly support Magento.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Scanners:</strong></p>
<p>Probably Dynamic Scanning is the better idea. Example, using <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP Zap</a> to test input fields of extensions. There are current efforts to get an easy to set up OWASP Zap fuzzer for Magento Extension makers.</p>
<p>There is a danger of reporting error in extensions without understanding the value of the error or making it easy to act on the error. Example, using tools that just dump a PDF of all the errors versus categorizing and ranking problems and putting them into bug tracker. We should have documentation of recommended fixes for the types of errors dynamic scanning provides.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities in extensions:</strong></p>
<p>A lot of extension providers are not prepared for a vulnerability in their extension. There are a few common problems with their approach. The problems we find with them, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not fixing vulnerabilities and ignoring input from developer community, or</li>
<li>Fixing vulnerabilities silently and not notifying their customers, or</li>
<li>No way of notifying their customers of a new version with a fix.</li>
</ul>
<p>There should be a process for responding to security vulnerabilities if extension makers want their extensions to be on the Marketplace. There should be consequences instead of enforcement when dealing with extension makers with vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Marketplace vs non-marketplace extensions:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the problems that we see are in extensions that are not from Marketplace, therefore enforcement of security policies may have the unintended consequence of reducing the number of extensions on the Magento Marketplace. One possible solution to extensions not on marketplace is that there may be a warning in Magento if it is code matched to an extension that is on the marketplace. This works for vendors that sell the same extension on Marketplace and on their own site.</p>
<p>One of the driving reasons for buying extensions from outside the marketplace is because updates from the Marketplace are too slow. The process is improving though.</p>
<p>It would be good if the marketplace extensions page would show the version that is on the Marketplace and show which past versions may be vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Known extension vulnerabilities database:</strong></p>
<p>Currently there is a community effort to track down vulnerabilities in Magento extensions (from the marketplace or not), you can find that open source list here: <a href="https://github.com/gwillem/magevulndb">https://github.com/gwillem/magevulndb</a></p>
<p>Pre and post hooks in Github to track if an existing extension has a known vulnerability will not work but running from the admin that reaches to the centralized repo like magevulndb may work. There is a n98-magerun extension that will check your existing extensions against the list on magevulndb.</p>
<p>Hashes of the files can tie into the vulnerability database, but it may become resource heavy for all files. Hash of the system vs last known good version of itself is an alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Note to extension makers:</strong></p>
<p>While more secure development is important, it is extremely critical to take security more seriously in your support processes. We have a problem with unused admin users on stores with known username/passwords that were assigned to an extension maker for support purposes. There are ways around this, example, temporary admin accounts or not the same password for each support incidence by extension maker.</p>
<p>There is also a problem where extension developers put restrictions on the PHP versions of their extensions such that it cannot be upgraded. It would be good if you can configure SemVer support properly.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent use of easy and known passwords in admin:</strong></p>
<p>Wagento has the <a href="https://blog.wagento.com/have-i-been-pwned">Have I Been Pwned</a> extension and there are possible other versions. It would be good if the HIBP extensions worked on the admin accounts too. Admin account needs more protection, so it makes more sense to implement this in admin login form as well.</p>
<p><strong>Making it easy for merchants:</strong></p>
<p>There is a lack of will on the part of merchants, so it is important that we make the tools we build as easy as possible for them to use/integrate. Yarn and NPM gives the developer a list of vulnerabilities but we don’t have that in Composer for PHP. <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories">Roave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker">Sensio labs</a> have checkers for this sort of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>How System Integrators can help:</strong></p>
<p>One option to tackle extension updates is tackle it from the SI point of view. It would be great if sales people can commit to % of budget for security and structuring contracts with merchants so that budget is included by default. It frees SI to do what needs to be done so merchants don’t get the sticker shock of maintenance that they didn’t expect. If there are no urgent security updates, then the merchant gets that time as extra development/features.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk when it comes to security being expensive for SIs but there are not a lot of conflicts because of security hotfixes.</p>
<h3 id="2-better-ways-to-report-vulnerabilities-on-a-merchants-site">2. Better ways to report vulnerabilities on a merchant’s site</h3>
<p><em>Magento has a bug bounty program to report vulnerabilities in their code and websites. If a user or security researcher finds vulnerabilities in some Magento powered web store, not owned by Magento – an Adobe company, how can they reach out to the right person on the merchant’s team? How to pass the information given the sensitive nature of the issue? Should Magento accept <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">security.txt standard</a>?</em></p>
<p><strong>Security.txt extension:</strong></p>
<p>There is an open source extension for Magento to display contact information as per security.txt standard: <a href="https://github.com/kalpmehta/securitytxt">https://github.com/kalpmehta/securitytxt</a></p>
<p>SI contact information should be on the security.txt since they are most likely responsible.</p>
<p>The nice thing is that Magento has good contact information for Commerce (Enterprise Edition) customers, this includes Version, URL, etc. which is passed to Magento during news check. Yet still you have to give Magento your email for access to the repo, so they do have access to many customers but attribution to stores are not always the easiest.</p>
<p>If merchants are not responding to contact when they’re hacked, the funny thing to do would be to call them out on twitter (never do that :D)</p>
<h3 id="3-code-review-in-community-submitted-pull-requests">3. Code review in community-submitted Pull Requests</h3>
<p><em>Is Magento doing security code review when someone submits a PR to core code? What to check for when doing code reviews to identify security risks?</em></p>
<p><strong>Escape HTML/JS before rendering:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, all the escapings in Magento are explicit, that means a Magento developer needs to escape output manually wherever needed, say with $block-&gt;escapeHtml() function calls in templates. By default, all the output through the echo language construct is not escaped. Potentially it could lead to unintended XSS vulnerabilities. The idea is to make the opposite default behavior so that all the default output should be escaped, say with escapeHtml function, while only exceptions (which no need to be escaped should be explicitly specified in code). The current task complicated with the fact that echo is not a function, but a language construct, thus it cannot be redefined.</p>
<p><strong>Considering backward compatibility:</strong></p>
<p>We need to take the backward compatibility requirements into account and prevent double escaping. Potentially a solution could be compiling the PHTML, this is heavyweight and complicated. Is there an easier way or faster way?</p>
<p>More info on template security here – <a href="https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/templates/template-security.html">https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/frontend-dev-guide/templates/template-security.html</a></p>
<p>Discussed this topic in weekly Magento architecture call as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/magento/architecture/issues/165">https://github.com/magento/architecture/issues/165</a></p>
<p><strong>Sanitize input before saving in DB:</strong></p>
<p>There are many places in the admin where you do not expect HTML code. Example, when saving Boolean values like yes/no, integer and decimal values for qty and pricing, most of the store configuration values, etc. Magento can restrict these all to disallow any HTML tags before saving to database. This can reduce the number of potential XSS when these values get rendered on the store front and admin.</p>
<h3 id="4-add-security-topics-in-developer-certifications">4. Add Security topics in Developer certifications</h3>
<p><em>Magento U have been including more topics on security in the exams. Should there be more or of different levels or separate exams? There are more security questions on the Developer plus exam but not the others.</em></p>
<p><strong>Include Security questions in existing certifications Vs. create new security certification?</strong></p>
<p>Magento has just started exploration of the training for security. They are optimizing for their plans of first training and maybe later certification. A separate certification.</p>
<p>Magento has gotten feedback that since security is such a broad topic the SI’s would like to see the certificate split up in the multiple levels. OWASP Top Ten at the lower levels to Forensics and more complex topics on the higher levels. There is an overwhelming yes to this plan.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime validity of the certification Vs. certifications with expiry date:</strong></p>
<p>Certifications should have an expiration date since these sorts of skills evolve rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Magento Security study material:</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, there shouldn’t be a monetary barrier to the study material related to Magento security. Probably the Magento Dev Docs is a good place for this.</p>
<p>Magento makes regular 5-minute training videos. These could also include the initial security topics, example, OWASP Top Ten.</p>
<p>By a large margin the most requested type of documentation are greenfield build security checklists. Probably Dev Docs is best place for a collaborative checklist.</p>
<p>Pablo brought some Ext DN pamphlets on Do’s and Don’ts. Also tips on secure Magento 2 development was very good. Here are those pamphlets that Piotr Kaminski shared on Twitter.</p>

<p>With this we were out of time as Dev Exchange only provided 45 mins of time slot for every topic discussion. However, I believe it was good enough time to get the feedback and ideas from everyone participated. We actually started few minutes earlier though, I feel sorry for Lee as he had to introduce himself 3 times because of official announcement to start all the talks and all the background noise interrupting him J</p>
<p>If you have any ideas around Magento security, please post it in a comment!</p>

This year would be crazy for me, as I am participating in Contribution Days as a Maintainer that happens on Saturday and Sunday before the conference, and also hosting a Dev Exchange table after the conference on Wednesday. Also, this would be my first Imagine from agency side, so things would be different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, I have advocated Magento Security for quite a while now. From submitting core security bugs to adding an entire Security topic in the Magento 2 Professional Developer Plus certification, I realized there is many more things to do. This year I am going to host Dev Exchange where I will share my security ideas and also get ideas and feedback from the community. One very important thing that we would address this year is third-party extensions security. Pablo Benitez, CTO at eBizmarts, will join me bringing in business perspective when talking about third-party extension security. Talesh Seeparsan will bring his past Dev Exchange experiences on security and help us in guiding and noting down all the ideas and feedback that we would discuss with all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Make Magento more secure</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s 2019 and security is a top priority of Magento/Adobe. Every participant in the ecosystem has their part to play to keep merchant stores secure. Let us discuss current low hanging fruits in the ecosystem and share strategies/tools for managing them effectively. For each item we will outline the topic and it’s security shortcomings then begin a deeper investigation into solutions with knowledge and idea sharing before moving to the next one. This is a co-hosted panel: Kalpesh Mehta leading with deep technical security experience and Pablo Benitez bringing the experience and technical/business concerns from an extension developer for a fully rounded conversation. Special thanks to Talesh Seeparsan and Kristof Ringleff for bringing their past Dev Exchange experience around extension security.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.) Extension Developers write secure code.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the proactive and nimble approach Magento has taken to core security, many time agencies and merchants find external 3rd party extensions makers have not put in as much effort. How can we encourage their developers to take a more secure coding approach? Can Magento community maintain secure coding practices document like <a href="https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/coding-standards/technical-guidelines.html#15-security"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical guidelines, security<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>? Validate code using a tool like PHP CodeSniffer ? What solutions already exist that we can rely on? What processes already exist that we can implement?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>2.) Better ways to report vulnerabilities on a merchant’s site</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Magento has a bug bounty program to report vulnerabilities in their code and websites. If a user or security researcher finds vulnerabilities in some Magento powered web store, not owned by Magento – an Adobe company, how can they reach out to the right person on the merchant’s team? How to pass the information given the sensitive nature of the issue? Should Magento accept <a href="https://securitytxt.org/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->security.txt standard<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.) Code review in community submitted Pull Requests<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is Magento doing security code review when someone submits a PR to core code? What to check for when doing code reviews to identify security risks?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4.) Add Security topics in Developer certifications<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Magento has already included Security topic in Magento 2 Professional Developer Plus exam. Can we ask Magento to include Security in Associate as well as Developer exam? Can it help developers learn security best practices?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All recommendations and suggestions will be documented and shared with the Magento security team and the community afterwards. Remember to keep the privacy of your client intact while discussing vulnerabilities and attacks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>It is just incredible that there were 5,900 contributors that Magento can quantify in 2018. I am so proud to be in the top 1% of the contributors who were recognized in the Top 50 contributors list. It is a very difficult job to find who contributed most or whose contributions impacted most given such a large community contributors, but Sherrie Rohde, Magento Community Manager, just excels in that.</p>

<p>As a side note, there were over 5,900 contributors (that we know of and could quantify) in the Magento Community in 2018. My mind is blown. 5,900?!</p>

The goal of this new certification is to test the developers’ skills in Magento 2 Commerce and Open Source. This exam is intended to be difficult than the Professional Developer that was launched earlier this year. The exam will be scenario-based, so don’t come memorizing class and method names to the exam, it will not help 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The exam will be scenario-based, so don’t come memorizing class and method names to the exam, it will not help 🙂</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>Developers from Magento, an Adobe Company and few SIs participated in this workshop to come up with the questions for this exam. Everybody was highly skilled in Magento 2, and submitted very good questions which will make it difficult for the developers to pass this exam 🙂 Partners who participated – Corra (I an Jonathan Lorenzi), Something Digital (Max Chadwick), DCKAP (Jaykanth), Vaimo (Sergii) and Cream NL (Julian).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And there were Alex Paliarush and Iryna from Magento. Vitaliy Golomoziy and Vinai Kopp were top of the game, submitting and reviewing some crazy amount of questions respectively. It was great to work with all these awesome folks for four days. This was all possible under the guidance of Peter Manijak, Director of Certification &amp; Special Programs at Magento U.</p>
<h3 id="new-topics">New topics</h3>
<p>This exam added two new topics that are different than Professional exam. First one is of course Magento 2 Commerce features. The other one, which I personally advocated for few years to include in different areas of the Magento ecosystem, is Magento Security.</p>
<h3 id="magento-security">Magento Security</h3>
<p>I proposed this topic to Peter Manijak few weeks before the workshop, he really liked the idea and gave his support to include this in the certification. We were not sure whether to add objectives in other topics or to create an entire new topic for this. Peter took this to the team and we agreed to keep it as it’s own topic. We also got support on this topic from Richard Huie-Buckius, Head of Training &amp; Certification Services at Magento, an Adobe Company. I am very grateful to Peter and Richard for understanding the importance of Security in Magento and making it a part of the certification. Peter is personally a big fan of Security so huge props to him on including this additional topic to the exam.</p>
<p>The goal to introduce Magento Security in the exam is to test developers’ abilities in security area when they develop something in Magento. Security is a part of development, every developer who works on Magento needs to know at least the basics of security to write secure code while developing extensions or custom in-house modules. The exam will test the developers on frontend, backend and overall architectural related security questions. For full details, wait for the study guide 🙂</p>
<h3 id="launch-date">Launch date</h3>
<p>The certification will be available to the developers in November 2018 (as per the tweet from Magento U handle).</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;M2 Certified Professional Developer test is here for a while now and I finally got some time to prepare and appear for this test. It asks you 60 questions which you have to answer in a time limit of 90 minutes. So basically you get 1.5 minutes to answer each question. Though you should not waste time if you are able to answer the question quicker, as there are many questions in the test which are lengthy and requires more time to understand the question. If you are a non-native English speaker, you may have to read some of the questions 2-3 times before fully understanding what it is exactly asking. Passing score is 64% – so you need to get 39 correct answers out of 60, which is almost 2 out of 3 questions. At the end of the test, you get the score on screen which is great to know instantly if you passed or you need to re-take the test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the end of the test, you get the score on screen which is great to know instantly if you passed or you need to re-take the test.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took the M2 Professional Developer test and passed it. I found it difficult to be honest, questions were lengthy and answers were confusing. Magento recommends developers to at least have 1.5 to 2 years of experience before taking this test to pass, but I think you can still go for the test if you have worked on 4-5 Magento 2 projects hands on with around a year of experience. I believe that is enough if you are fully into Magento and understand the architecture of the system and technical concepts of various features it offers.</p>
<p>I found SwiftOtter very useful, along with it’s practice test where it offers 44 questions <a href="https://swiftotter.com/technical/certifications/magento-2-certified-developer-practice-test">https://swiftotter.com/technical/certifications/magento-2-certified-developer-practice-test</a>. However, it’s not guaranteed that you will pass solely by studying their guide and practice test. You also need to understand the code and should have experience working on it in the M2 projects to clear the exam. I suggest taking the practice test once you have read and understood the topics in the guide and Magento DevDocs and are ready to face the real test.</p>
<p>It’s evident there’s a lot of hard work done by the Magento U team and developers who contributed to this test by writing questions and answers. It’s really hard to pass this test if you don’t have deep understanding in Magento 2 concepts and don’t have enough practical knowledge to prove your M2 abilities.</p>
<p><em><strong>I think this test could have done even better if it had also focused on:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Security</em> – Not a single question was asked on this topic. I am not talking about Payment, PCI and Magento Vault things when I say Security, I mean writing code that does not leave behind security vulnerabilities. It should be must for a backend or full-stack developer to at least have a basic understanding of how to write secure code, Magento had a great opportunity to include some good security questions (like CSRF token, escaping user-submitted data, XSS prevention, preventing file path exploits, sanitizing user data before saving/getting from db, etc..) here, but….</p>
<p><em>Readability</em> – Most of the Magento developers are from non-native English speaking countries, myself included. I feel there were few lengthy questions which were just difficult to understand for non-native speakers. I also heard similar complaints from few developers who took this test confirming that they had to read some of the questions 2-3 times which took much of their time to just understand what the questions were trying to ask. That’s a disadvantage to many developers and I believe Magento U will take a note of that when writing upcoming new test questions.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts! Kudos to Magento U team for creating such an outstanding test.</p>

      <title>Setting up Magento 2.2.3 on Valet&#43; (requires MacOS)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering what is Valet+? It is a development environment for MacOS. If you have previously used Vagrant and/or Docker, I think you would just love Valet+.

Valet+ is very easy yet fast development environment, as it doesn’t require you to edit /etc/hosts, vhosts, mysql, etc..

<p>Let me know in comments section which one you prefer out of these 3?</p>
<p>Okay so let’s come to topic and start preparing to install Valet and Magento.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Install <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> if you do not have it already on your Mac</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.) Let’s install PHP 7.1</strong></p>
<p>brew install homebrew/php/php71</p>
<p>If you already have php70, you can unlink it before running above command:</p>
<p>brew unlink php70</p>
<p>{code}</p>
<p>Kalpeshs-MBP:~ kalpesh$ brew install php71<br>

==&gt; Caveats<br>
The php.ini file can be found in:<br>
/usr/local/etc/php/7.1/php.ini</p>
<p>✩✩✩✩ Extensions ✩✩✩✩</p>
<p>If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:</p>
<p>PATH=”/usr/local/bin:$PATH”</p>
<p>PHP71 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them using –without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.</p>
<p>✩✩✩✩ PHP CLI ✩✩✩✩</p>
<p>If you wish to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should add the following to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile or your shell’s equivalent configuration file:<br>
export PATH=”$(brew –prefix homebrew/php/php71)/bin:$PATH”</p>
<p>✩✩✩✩ FPM ✩✩✩✩</p>
<p>To launch php-fpm on startup:<br>
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents<br>
cp /usr/local/opt/php71/homebrew.mxcl.php71.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<br>
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php71.plist</p>
<p>The control script is located at /usr/local/opt/php71/sbin/php71-fpm</p>
<p>OS X 10.8 and newer come with php-fpm pre-installed, to ensure you are using the brew version you need to make sure /usr/local/sbin is before /usr/sbin in your PATH:</p>
<p>PATH=”/usr/local/sbin:$PATH”</p>
<p>You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct “UserName”.</p>
<p>Please note that the plist was called ‘homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php71.plist’ in old versions of this formula.</p>
<p>With the release of macOS Sierra the Apache module is now not built by default. If you want to build it on your system you have to install php with the –with-httpd option. See brew options php71 for more details.</p>
<p>By 31st March 2018 we will deprecate and archive the PHP tap.<br>
Some of the formulae will be migrated to homebrew-core.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/issues/4721">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php/issues/4721</a></p>
<p>To have launchd start homebrew/php/php71 now and restart at login:<br>
brew services start homebrew/php/php71<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By default, if you want to redirect request with POST data, browser redirects it via GET with 302 redirect. This also drops all the POST data associated with the request. Browser does this as a precaution to prevent any unintentional re-submitting of POST transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to redirect anyway POST request with it’s data? In HTTP 1.1, there is a status code for this. Status code 307 indicates that the request should be repeated with the same HTTP method and data. So your POST request will be repeated along with it’s data if you use this status code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>But what if you want to redirect anyway POST request with it’s data? In HTTP 1.1, there is a status code for this. Status code 307 indicates that the request should be repeated with the same HTTP method and data. So your POST request will be repeated along with it’s data if you use this status code.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</a>,<br>
<em>If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, <strong>the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request</strong> unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.</em></p>
<p>I did this in one of the website to redirect HTTP request to HTTPS for a specific page.</p>
<p>{code}RewriteEngine on<br>
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !443<br>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} string_to_match_in_url<br>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST<br>
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [L,R=307]{/code}</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to have mod_rewrite enabled on the server. The first RewriteCond checks if the request is NOT coming as HTTPS, otherwise it will go in endless loop. If yes, the second RewriteCond checks if the URL contains a string we are looking for. Then if that URL is being submitted as POST method. If everything matches, then we redirect the request using HTTPS secure protocol retaining the POST method and the associated data.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show you how to upgrade Magento 2.0.5 (2.0.*) to 2.1.6 which is latest CE version as of today. We will do it using composer via server command-line interface. It is recommended to take code and DB backup and do this upgrade on your development/stage server first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Magento 2 comes with Web Setup Wizard (under Admin &amp;gt; System) where you can upgrade from admin panel itself, but for some reason it was always failing for me at Readiness Check’s Component Dependency check.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Magento 2 comes with Web Setup Wizard (under Admin &gt; System) where you can upgrade from admin panel itself, but for some reason it was always failing for me at Readiness Check’s Component Dependency check.</p>
<p>Step 1.) Edit the composer.json which should be located at the root of your store. Change <strong>version</strong> and <strong>magento/product-community-edition</strong> from 2.0.* (whatever you have currently) to 2.1.6 or any latest version you wish to upgrade to. Also change sample data versions from 100.0.* to 100.1.*<br>

<p>While modifying Aheadworks follow up extension on our store to meet our specific requirements, I discovered multiple security vulnerabilities in the extension. As the vulnerabilities were pretty serious, I immediately sent my discoveries to Magento team which they promptly sent to Aheadworks team. Aheadworks was quick enough to fix the vulnerabilities and rolled out the patches.</p>
<p>Link of the extension in Magento Marketplace:<br>
<a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/aheadworks-follow-up-email.html">https://marketplace.magento.com/aheadworks-follow-up-email.html</a><br>
It allows store owners to send automated emails to customers who had abandoned their cart.<br>
<img src="http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fue-2.png" alt="Aheadworks follow up email extension"></p>
<p>All the below vulnerabilities were found in the extension.</p>
<p><strong>1. SQL injection</strong><br>
<strong>2. Directory Traversal vulnerability</strong><br>
<em>Attacker can traverse to any directory on the server. In earlier PHP versions (prior to 5.3.4), attacker can read any file on server including /etc/passwd</em><br>
<strong>3. Unrestricted Directories creation</strong><br>
<em>Attacker can create any number of directories and subdirectories with their desired name wherever web server has permissions</em></p>
<p>I will not disclose any technical details and PoC of the vulnerabilties here to prevent wild exploits on Magento websites having this extension installed.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong><br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can add static block to CMS page in Magento in following 2 ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.) By adding code in Layout Update XML of CMS page:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=xml}&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;lt;block_id&amp;gt;STATIC_BLOCK_ID_HERE&amp;lt;/block_id&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;{/code}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.)

      <title>Magento: Zipcode &#43; 4 tax calculation bug fix</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2015-09-04-magento-zipcode-4-tax-calculation-bug-fix/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento bug fix for zipcode + 4 in tax calculation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tax Calculation in Magento has a bug where customer can escape paying tax if they enter zipcode + 4 digit in USA. This is because you import 5 digit zipcodes with their tax rates in Magento admin, so if customer inputs their zipcode in zipcode+4 format their zipcode will not match with the imported one. Importing 5-digit zipcode ending in wildcard (*) does not solve this issue either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento bug fix for zipcode + 4 in tax calculation</p>
<p>Tax Calculation in Magento has a bug where customer can escape paying tax if they enter zipcode + 4 digit in USA. This is because you import 5 digit zipcodes with their tax rates in Magento admin, so if customer inputs their zipcode in zipcode+4 format their zipcode will not match with the imported one. Importing 5-digit zipcode ending in wildcard (*) does not solve this issue either.</p>
<p>Before this fix: If zipcode 90036 collects tax, 90036-1234 does NOT collect tax.</p>
<p>You can fix this bug by adding below code in your custom module:</p>
<p>config.xml<br>
{code}…<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;tax_resource&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Namespace_Module_Model_Tax_Resource_Calculation<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;/tax_resource&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
…{/code}</p>
<p>Note that we are rewriting core logic of Tax Calculation. Now create folder structure in your custom module: app/code/local/Namespace/Module/Model/Tax/Resource/Calculation.php and copy below code:</p>
<p>{code}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
getCountryId();<br>
$regionId = $request-&gt;getRegionId();<br>
$postcode = $request-&gt;getPostcode();</p>
<p>//12 = california, 25 = iowa<br>
if($countryId == ‘US’ &amp;&amp; in_array($regionId,array(12,25))) {<br>
$postcode = substr(trim($request-&gt;getPostcode()),0,5);<br>
$request-&gt;setPostcode($postcode);<br>
}<br>
return parent::_getRates($request);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}{/code}</p>
<p>Above code will only take first 5 digits from the zipcode if the country is USA and state selected is either California or Iowa. You can change the states as per your requirement, to know what ID relates to different states you can look at the State/Province dropdown source code in checkout page.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento checkout cart gives 500 error and redirect loops when there is a shopping cart rule with Category condition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found a bug in Magento which redirects shopping cart indefinitely causing it 500 internal server error. This can be a serious bug as customer will not able to shop if this happens. I noticed this happens when there is a shopping cart rule which have Category in conditions of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento checkout cart gives 500 error and redirect loops when there is a shopping cart rule with Category condition.</p>
<p>I found a bug in Magento which redirects shopping cart indefinitely causing it 500 internal server error. This can be a serious bug as customer will not able to shop if this happens. I noticed this happens when there is a shopping cart rule which have Category in conditions of the rule.</p>
<p>If total quantity equals or greater than 1 for a subselection of items in cart matching ALL of these conditions:<br>
<strong>Category</strong> is 125</p>
<p>So for example you have a shopping cart rule where you want to give some discount or free product if at least one product is chosen from specific Category, this triggers the error in frontend shopping cart. Main reason here is <strong>Category</strong> condition. If you remove category condition then the error should go away. But if you want to keep the category condition and still want Magento to handle the shopping cart promotion rule, check the code changes below:</p>
<p>To solve this I copied below file to my local<br>
app/code/core/Mage/SalesRule/Model/Rule/Condition/Product/Combine.php</p>
<p>and edited the function validate:<br>
{code type=php}/**<br>
* Validate a condition with the checking of the child value<br>
* @param Varien_Object $object<br>
*<br>
* @return bool<br>
*/<br>
public function validate(Varien_Object $object)<br>
{<br>
/** @var Mage_Catalog_Model_Product $product */<br>
$product = $object-&gt;getProduct();<br>
if (!($product instanceof Mage_Catalog_Model_Product)) {<br>
$product = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($object-&gt;getProductId());<br>
}</p>
<p>$valid = parent::validate($object);</p>
<p>/* Kalpesh commented whole block, as it causes redirect loop and Segmentation fault in apache<br>
if (!$valid &amp;&amp; $product-&gt;getTypeId() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type_Configurable::TYPE_CODE) {<br>
$children = $object-&gt;getChildren();<br>
//$valid = $children &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;validate($children[0]); //Kalpesh commented, issue….<br>
}*/</p>
<p>return $valid;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Hope this helps to some troubled souls!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento EE 1.14 introduces a bug fix which apparently becomes a bug in our website. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ee114-later-release-notes#ee114-1400fixes-other&#34;&gt;Magento EE 1.14.0.0 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce19-later-release-notes#ce19-1900fixes-other&#34;&gt;Magento CE 1.9.0.0 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; lists this in it’s Bug Fixes:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Google Sitemap files now include the .html suffix for category and product URLs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don’t have .html suffix in our category and product URLs, so we were good before this fix. But after upgrading it to latest version all the category and product URLs were having “.” (dot) at the end in XML sitemap. This is because Magento allows admin to give a custom suffix for category and product URLs for sitemap, but hardcodes “.” regardless of there are values in the above config fields or not. This allows unnecessary dots in all the URLs which can lead to 404 pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We don’t have .html suffix in our category and product URLs, so we were good before this fix. But after upgrading it to latest version all the category and product URLs were having “.” (dot) at the end in XML sitemap.

<p>Magento team have used observer to observe the events <em>sitemap_categories_generating_before</em> and <em>sitemap_products_generating_before</em> to add the suffix in the following file and functions (Notice I have commented all lines in the functions):<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento, if you want to change canonical URL for just one category or quite a few categories, and don’t want to affect rest of the canonical URLs then do the following.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this is helpful when you already have canonical URL in the page and want to REPLACE it with new url. If you don’t have canonical URL at all then you might want to ignore the first &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; tag in the below code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Magento, if you want to change canonical URL for just one category or quite a few categories, and don’t want to affect rest of the canonical URLs then do the following.</p>
<p>Note that this is helpful when you already have canonical URL in the page and want to REPLACE it with new url. If you don’t have canonical URL at all then you might want to ignore the first <em>action</em> tag in the below code.</p>
<p>– Go to the category page you want to change canonical URL in Magento Admin<br>
– Click the tab “Custom Design”<br>
– In the Custom Layout Update textbox, paste this:</p>
<p>{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->link_rel<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://loca.lho.st/old-canonical-url">http://loca.lho.st/old-canonical-url</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->canonical<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://loca.lho.st/new-canonical-url">http://loca.lho.st/new-canonical-url</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{/code}</p>
<p>Change <em><a href="http://loca.lho.st/old-canonical-url">http://loca.lho.st/old-canonical-url</a></em> and <em><a href="http://loca.lho.st/new-canonical-url">http://loca.lho.st/new-canonical-url</a></em> with your desired URLs and save the category.</p>
<p>Basically first <em>action</em> tag in the code removes old canonical URL and second <em>action</em> tag adds the canonical URL with the new value you specify.</p>
<p>You may also need to clear cache.</p>
<p>HTH!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before 6 months I found a bug in Magento CE 1.9 and EE 1.13 (latest versions at that time) in Sales Order report calculation during Daylight Savings Time period. I reported it to Magento through their Bug Tracking ticket but after 6 months also there is no reply no progress on that issue. I provided all the details on how to reproduce it and also provided solution to fix the issue. The issue is not yet resolved in latest Magento versions (I have checked Enterprise Edition 1.14.1.0 which is latest stable version now) so I decided to post it online so that other developers/clients who are experiencing same issue during DST (which have started) period can fix it and fetch correct numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Overview of issue:</strong><br>
Sales order grid data (Admin-&gt;Sales-&gt;Orders) for certain date range is not matching with the report sales order data (Admin-&gt;Reports-&gt;Sales-&gt;Orders). There is some difference in numbers which made me drill into the Magento source code. Upon further investigation I saw Zend_Date’s set method was used without 2nd argument which took the date in wrong format messing with the totals.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong><br>
1. Login in Admin panel<br>
2. Go to Reports-&gt;Sales-&gt;Orders screen<br>
3. Filter orders for some date range which should fall in Daylight savings time.<br>
4. Notice the totals which are shown are not 100% correct.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Result:</strong><br>
The totals in Reports-&gt;Sales-&gt;Orders screen should match totals in Sales-&gt;Orders grid screen when downloading CSV from there. I have attached the issue in detail along with solution in the attached file.</p>
<p><strong>Actual Result:</strong><br>
The totals in Reports-&gt;Sales-&gt;Orders screen is not coming correct when date range filter falls in daylight savings time.</p>
<p><strong>Magento version affected:</strong><br>
It seems all CE and EE versions, I only checked CE 1.8, 1.9 and EE 1.13, 1.14</p>
<p><strong>Files Affected:</strong><br>
app/code/core/Mage/Reports/Model/Resource/Report/Abstract.php<br>
app/code/core/Mage/Reports/Model/Mysql4/Report/Abstract.php (In older magento versions using Mysql4 instead of Resource)</p>
<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong><br>
In the file app/code/core/Mage/Reports/Model/Resource/Report/Abstract.php<br>
function: _getTZOffsetTransitions<br>
line 418, $dateTimeObject-&gt;set($tr[‘time’]);</p>
<p>$dateTimeObject is object of Zend_Date() and expects parameter 2 for the date/time format<br>
<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.date.basic.html#zend.date.simple.functions.set">http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.date.basic.html#zend.date.simple.functions.set</a></p>
<p>After changing this line:<br>
{code}$dateTimeObject-&gt;set($tr[‘time’]);{/code}<br>
with<br>
{code}$dateTimeObject-&gt;set($tr[‘time’], Varien_Date::DATETIME_INTERNAL_FORMAT);{/code}</p>
<p>the issue was fixed and the order totals were shown correctly in Reports-&gt;Sales-&gt;Order screen.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> After the above change it is required to re-build lifetime statistics of Orders to update database table sales_order_aggregated_created.</p>
<p>Make the change by copying the core file to your local so that future upgrade will not overwrite your fix.</p>

      <title>Magento error: SCP 404: GET /spp/ajax/?___SID=Uco/?id=460&amp;#038;pid=123</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using Magento extension Simple Configurable Product (SCP &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/simple-configurable-products.html)&#34;&gt;http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/simple-configurable-products.html)&lt;/a&gt;, it gets dangerous sometimes when you have configured Special Prices or Tiered Pricing. It requests for prices via ajax after page is loaded. For some customers having old system and browser, this results in sending ___SID (session ID) along with GET request parameter, which causes double question mark in the URL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the ajax URL should be:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code}http://ma.gen.to/spp/ajax/co?id=460&amp;amp;pid=123{/code}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where it requests to module’s AjaxController and coAction() method, with parameters id (product ID) and pid (parent ID). This should go good without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are using Magento extension Simple Configurable Product (SCP <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/simple-configurable-products.html)">http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/simple-configurable-products.html)</a>, it gets dangerous sometimes when you have configured Special Prices or Tiered Pricing. It requests for prices via ajax after page is loaded. For some customers having old system and browser, this results in sending ___SID (session ID) along with GET request parameter, which causes double question mark in the URL.</p>
<p>Ideally, the ajax URL should be:<br>
{code}http://ma.gen.to/spp/ajax/co?id=460&amp;pid=123{/code}</p>
<p>where it requests to module’s AjaxController and coAction() method, with parameters id (product ID) and pid (parent ID). This should go good without any issue.</p>
<p>{code}http://ma.gen.to/spp/ajax/?___SID=Uco/?id=460&amp;pid=123{/code}</p>
<p>But, ___SID=U, which is used in the cache as a placeorder, also goes along with the parameters it creates a problem. As there are two “?” in the URL, Magento will try to see for AjaxController’s indexAction() because when you don’t have anything for action part in URL, it by defaults to indexAction of the controller.</p>
<p>The problem doesn’t end in just a 404 error in error log, this also DISPLAYS whole 404 page just below the product price in product page. So, customer will get confused as there is a big 404 page inside the product page and configurable attributes like size, color and quantity box are pushed down. This may result in low sales when it appears frequently.</p>
<p>The easiest way to fix this is to create an action indexAction() and check if you have ___SID as a parameter, then just ignore it.</p>
<p>Add the following code in your module’s AjaxController.php file, just above the coAction():</p>
<p>{code type=php}public function indexAction() {<br>
$p = $this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getParam(‘___SID’);<br>
if($p) { return ”; }<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>This will solve the weird 404 page that gets displayed in product page, but not the 404 error coming up in the logs. You need to remove ?___SID=U from the URL when it appears in the request to completely resolve the issue.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fix for Magento error &lt;strong&gt;Code already exists.&lt;/strong&gt; in Sales &amp;gt; Tax &amp;gt; Manage Tax Rules, when saving the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When trying to save Tax rules in Magento, you may get “Code already exists.” error if there are lots of tax rates passing in POST. Magento error is not making sense here, as the issue is something different. Basically when you post the data in PHP, it limits maximum post variables which should pass to the server. For me, that limit was 1000 in max_input_vars, which by changing to 20000 solved this issue and Magento successfully accepted my changes without any error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fix for Magento error <strong>Code already exists.</strong> in Sales &gt; Tax &gt; Manage Tax Rules, when saving the rule.</p>
<p>When trying to save Tax rules in Magento, you may get “Code already exists.” error if there are lots of tax rates passing in POST. Magento error is not making sense here, as the issue is something different. Basically when you post the data in PHP, it limits maximum post variables which should pass to the server. For me, that limit was 1000 in max_input_vars, which by changing to 20000 solved this issue and Magento successfully accepted my changes without any error.</p>
<p>To change max_input_vars to higher value, you need to edit in PHP.ini file for max_input_vars like this:<br>
{code}max_input_vars 20000{/code}</p>
<p>But as editing PHP.ini requires restarting apache to reflect the changes, I did the change in .htaccess file just for Tax rule modification and later reverted it.</p>
<p>You can edit .htaccess to make this change by copy-pasting below line at the end of the file:<br>
{code}php_value max_input_vars 20000{/code}</p>
<p>Now you should be able to change Tax rules even if you have lots of tax rates posting through for that change! I prefered to revert .htaccess back to what it was as I didn’t need to change tax rules frequently.</p>
<p>Note: If the above does not solve the issue for you, make sure your Tax Rule name is not duplicating with another tax rule name.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ShellShock is new Linux vulnerability affecting all versions of Bash package. This vulnerability is worse than HeartBleed! This command line vulnerability is present in Mac OS X too. Basically it’s there in all the systems having Bash, a software used to control the command line in Unix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To test if you are vulnerable to ShellShock, run this command:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code}env x=&amp;rsquo;() { :;}; echo vulnerable’ bash -c “echo this is a test”{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you see output:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code}vulnerable&lt;br&gt;&#xA;this is a test{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;that means you are vulnerable!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When customer uses gift card in their order Magento does not display gift card code and amount details in admin panel which makes it tough to know. Customer can pay partially through gift card which makes even tougher as Magento only shows payment information of other method and not gift card amount deductions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below code will show you an additional block in magento admin panel with Gift Card details. If gift card is not used in an order, the block will simply no shown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your Magento shopping cart kicking out all the items after 24 minutes? Are you frustrated because your customer’s cart items are getting flushed every few hours even though you have correct setting in Magento? Do you want to increase your shopping cart sessions to last for 1 day (or anything you wish)?</p>
<p>Here are the things to look for to increase/decrease Magento’s session cookie lifetime.</p>
<p>In your php.ini file:<br>
{code}session.gc_maxlifetime 86400{/code}<br>
If you have not changed this, it should be by default 1440 i.e. 24 minutes. Change it to 86400 for one day session lifetime</p>
<p>In your Magento admin:<br>
{code}System -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Checkout -&gt; Shopping Cart<br>
Quote Lifetime (days) -&gt; 1{/code}</p>
<p>{code}System -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Web -&gt; Session Cookie Management<br>
Cookie Lifetime -&gt; 86400{/code}</p>
<p>Make sure to check if you are in correct website/store if using multi-website/multi-store Magento setup. You can change the scope by changing the website/store from the upper left Store Switcher drop down in System -&gt; Configuration screen.</p>
<p>If you are changing php.ini value, make sure you reload apache to reflect the changes.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento clear all caches from command line, programatically from ssh. Clearing the caches is a must when you are making any configuration changes in your Magento website. Although you can always clear the cache from admin panel, sometimes for faster cleaning or unable to log into admin panel reason, it’s good to have a script which will clear all the caches in Magento.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create a file in your Magento root and name it clearCache.php with the below code:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}&amp;lt;?php echo &amp;ldquo;Start Cleaning all caches at &amp;hellip; &amp;quot; . date(&amp;ldquo;Y-m-d H:i:s&amp;rdquo;) . &amp;ldquo;\n\n&amp;rdquo;;&#xA;ini_set(&amp;ldquo;display_errors&amp;rdquo;, 1);&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Clearing the caches is a must when you are making any configuration changes in your Magento website. Although you can always clear the cache from admin panel, sometimes for faster cleaning or unable to log into admin panel reason, it’s good to have a script which will clear all the caches in Magento.</p>
<p>Create a file in your Magento root and name it clearCache.php with the below code:<br>
{code type=php}&lt;?php echo &ldquo;Start Cleaning all caches at &hellip; &quot; . date(&ldquo;Y-m-d H:i:s&rdquo;) . &ldquo;\n\n&rdquo;;
ini_set(&ldquo;display_errors&rdquo;, 1);</p>
<p>require &lsquo;app/Mage.php&rsquo;;
Mage::app(&lsquo;admin&rsquo;)-?&gt;
setUseSessionInUrl(false);<br>
Mage::getConfig()-&gt;init();</p>
<p>$types = Mage::app()-&gt;getCacheInstance()-&gt;getTypes();</p>
<p>try {<br>
echo “Cleaning data cache… \n”;<br>
flush();<br>
foreach ($types as $type =&gt; $data) {<br>
echo “Removing $type … “;<br>
echo Mage::app()-&gt;getCacheInstance()-&gt;clean($data[“tags”]) ? “Cache cleared!” : “There is some error!”;<br>
echo “\n”;<br>
}<br>
} catch (exception $e) {<br>
die(“[ERROR:” . $e-&gt;getMessage() . “]”);<br>
}</p>
<p>echo “\n”;</p>
<p>try {<br>
echo “Cleaning stored cache… “;<br>
flush();<br>
echo Mage::app()-&gt;getCacheInstance()-&gt;clean() ? “Cache cleared!” : “There is some error!”;<br>
echo “\n\n”;<br>
} catch (exception $e) {<br>
die(“[ERROR:” . $e-&gt;getMessage() . “]”);<br>
}<br>
?&gt;{/code}<br>
Make sure all the double quotes comes good in copy pasting.</p>
<p>You can now run this script by the command “php -f clearCache.php” from your magento root location in terminal and this will start clearing all the caches for you! Once done, it will confirm by the message “Cache cleared!” or giving error message if it fails.</p>

      <title>Magento: Enable logs on API calls</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2014-06-22-magento-enable-logs-on-api-calls/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2014 18:16:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2014-06-22-magento-enable-logs-on-api-calls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no setting to enable/disable API calls in Magento, but you can do so by modifying a file which handles all the API calls and logging the requests in a custom log file. This is useful when you know that there are many API calls being requested by third party applications to your website but not sure what is actually being called, how many times, and at what day and time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no setting to enable/disable API calls in Magento, but you can do so by modifying a file which handles all the API calls and logging the requests in a custom log file. This is useful when you know that there are many API calls being requested by third party applications to your website but not sure what is actually being called, how many times, and at what day and time.</p>
<p>With that said, open the file: app/code/core/Mage/Api/Model/Server/Handler/Abstract.php<br>
and find the function “call” which handles all the API calls. Scroll down the function and find the if block which says:</p>
<p>{code type=php}if (method_exists($model, $method)) {<br>
if (isset($methodInfo-&gt;arguments) &amp;&amp; ((string)$methodInfo-&gt;arguments) == ‘array’) {<br>
return $model-&gt;$method((is_array($args) ? $args : array($args)));<br>
} elseif (!is_array($args)) {<br>
return $model-&gt;$method($args);<br>
} else {<br>
return call_user_func_array(array(&amp;$model, $method), $args);<br>
}<br>
} else {<br>
throw new Mage_Api_Exception(‘resource_path_not_callable’);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>and replace it with:</p>
<p>{code type=php}if (method_exists($model, $method)) {<br>
Mage::log($method, null, ‘api.log’); //logs the method<br>
Mage::log($args, null, ‘api.log’); //logs the arguments<br>
if (isset($methodInfo-&gt;arguments) &amp;&amp; ((string)$methodInfo-&gt;arguments) == ‘array’) {<br>
return $model-&gt;$method((is_array($args) ? $args : array($args)));<br>
} elseif (!is_array($args)) {<br>
return $model-&gt;$method($args);<br>
} else {<br>
return call_user_func_array(array(&amp;$model, $method), $args);<br>
}<br>
} else {<br>
throw new Mage_Api_Exception(‘resource_path_not_callable’);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now you should have your var/log/api.log file filled with the “method” and “arguments” requested by third party systems on your server. This should help you in knowing what was requested and at what time in your new log file.</p>

      <title>Magento enterprise: show top mini cart when product is added to cart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento Enterprise comes with a top header mini-cart, which displays all the items with their custom options added to cart, when you click on My Cart in the header. This is a good feature, but what if you want to show this mini-cart each time a product is added, without clicking on that link? I will show you here how to display your mini cart automatically when a product is added to cart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento Enterprise comes with a top header mini-cart, which displays all the items with their custom options added to cart, when you click on My Cart in the header. This is a good feature, but what if you want to show this mini-cart each time a product is added, without clicking on that link? I will show you here how to display your mini cart automatically when a product is added to cart.</p>
<p>Open your cartheader.php file, which is located at:<br>
<em>app/design/frontend/enterprise/YOUR_DESIGN/template/checkout/cart/cartheader.phtml</em></p>
<p>In the last few lines of this file, you should find the below line in javascript:</p>
<p>{code type=javascript}Enterprise.TopCart.initialize(‘topCartContent’);<br>
// Below can be used to show minicart after item added<br>
// Enterprise.TopCart.showCart(7);{/code}</p>
<p>Replace the last line, <strong>//Enterprise.TopCart.showCart(7);</strong> with the below lines:</p>
<p>{code type=javascript}jQuery( document ).ready(function() {<br>
if( jQuery(‘#messages_product_view’).children().length ){<br>
if(jQuery(‘#messages_product_view’).children().children().attr(‘class’) == ‘success-msg’) {<br>
if(jQuery(‘.success-msg ul li span’).text().indexOf(‘was added to your shopping cart’) &gt; -1) {<br>
Enterprise.TopCart.showCart(7);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}<br>
});{/code}</p>
<p>So whenever in the page, there will be an element with ID “#messages_product_view” and it has a children with class “success-msg” and it has a ul/li/span with text containing “was added to your shopping cart”, we will show the top mini-cart. This is only true when an product is added to shopping cart.</p>
<p>You can also show top mini-cart without this jquery hack, by making a new module in Magento and catch the event when product is added to cart. Then programmatically clicking the top mini cart to display it. But according to me this small piece of code is better than to create whole new Magento module.</p>
<p>HTH!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento if there is any error in XML file, Magento silently ignores it and continues further parsing. So you never get to know where is the actual error and makes it difficult to debug. You can’t even do any logging in XML file and also Magento don’t tell that error is in XML. It makes debugging almost impossible and ends up wasting in hours to find some silly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It makes debugging almost impossible and ends up wasting in hours to find some silly mistake.</p>
<p>But we can know if there is any error in XML (layout.xml or config.xml or any xml file) if you use below code in the controller action which is being called. The browser will display WHOLE XML code and if it encounters any error in it, simply gives where is the error in the XML tree.</p>
<p>If you are trying to load let’s say Product View page, then put this code in Mage/Catalog/controllers/ProductController.php file’s viewAction() method temporarily to display whole XML tree to find out error(s) if any. As we are saying to display the page as XML, the page will break if it finds any mal-formed XML code and will show where is the mistake.</p>
<p>{code type=php}header(“Content-Type: text/xml”);<br>
echo Mage::app()-&gt;getConfig()-&gt;getNode()-&gt;asXml();exit;{/code}</p>
<p>If you want to debug Layout Handles only, you can just check by this code:<br>
{code type=php}header(“Content-Type: text/xml”);<br>
echo Mage::app()-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;getUpdate()-&gt;getHandles();exit;{/code}</p>

<p>$collection = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)<br>
-&gt;getCollection()<br>
-&gt;addAttributeToSelect(‘sku’)<br>
-&gt;addAttributeToSelect(‘vendor’); //replace vendor with your attribute code</p>
<p>$data = $collection-&gt;getData();</p>
<p>foreach ($data as $product) {<br>
echo $product[‘entity_id’] . “,” . $product[‘vendor’].”\n”;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>After saving the above code, run it from command line:</p>
<p>{code}php vendor.php &gt; vendor.csv{/code}<br>
You should now have all the attribute’s data with product ID in the vendor.csv (your_attribute.csv) file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.)</strong> Now get all the unique values you have in the attribute’s data, which we will be filling them as options of select dropdown.<br>
Run following mysql command to get all the unique values and copy them in a new file:<br>
{code type=sql}select distinct value from catalog_product_entity_varchar where attribute_id in (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where attribute_code=’vendor’); //replace vendor with your own attribute code{/code}</p>
<p>After this step, we have all the attribute’s data in CSV file, and all the UNIQUE attribute values.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.)</strong> Note all the settings of the attribute and Delete the attribute from backend Manage Attributes screen. Now create new attribute from there with SAME attribute code but different Frontend Type (Dropdown). Rest all the settings will be same as you had it before. Save it. Go to Manage Attribute Sets page and assign the attribute to the Group it was assigned to before.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.)</strong> Now we have to insert all the options to this attribute so that the values are shown in the dropdown. Edit your vendor.php file and replace the code with below:<br>
{code type=php}require “app/Mage.php”;<br>
umask(0);<br>
Mage::app();</p>
<p>$installer = new Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup(‘core_setup’);<br>
$installer-&gt;startSetup();</p>
<p>//Change this….<br>
$values = array(“val1″,”val2”); //your unique attributes values that you copied in a new file<br>
$attrCode = ‘vendor’; //your attribute code here<br>
//……..</p>
<p>$values = array_map(‘utf8_encode’,$values); //If you’re using special characters<br>
$iProductEntityTypeId = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;getResource()-&gt;getTypeId();<br>
$aOption = array();<br>
$aOption[‘attribute_id’] = $installer-&gt;getAttributeId($iProductEntityTypeId, $attrCode);<br>
for($iCount=0;$iCount<!-- raw HTML omitted -->addAttributeOption($aOption);<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>$installer-&gt;endSetup();{/code}</p>
<p>After running this, check your attribute manage page and see if all the values are updated or not. You can find the values in “Manage Labels/Options” tab of attribute’s Manage Attributes screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.)</strong> Now comes the main part which will insert the attribute values in the database. The old values are stored in catalog_product_entity_varchar (text type), while now the values should go to catalog_product_entity_int (dropdown type). Replace your vendor.php file with below code:</p>
<p>{code type=php}require “app/Mage.php”;<br>
umask(0);<br>
Mage::app();</p>
<p>$attribute = Mage::getModel(‘eav/config’)-&gt;getAttribute(‘catalog_product’, ‘vendor’); //change to your attribute code<br>
$allOptions = $attribute-&gt;getSource()-&gt;getAllOptions(true, true);<br>
foreach ($allOptions as $instance) {<br>
$myArray[$instance[‘label’]] = $instance[‘value’];<br>
}</p>
<p>if (($handle = fopen(“vendor.csv”, “r”)) !== FALSE) { //change to your attribute .csv file<br>
while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, “,”)) !== FALSE) {<br>
list($_id, $_value) = $data;</p>
<p>$product = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($_id);<br>
$product-&gt;setVendor($myArray[$_value]); //setVendor should be setYourAttributeCode</p>
<p>try {<br>
$product-&gt;getResource()-&gt;saveAttribute($product, ‘vendor’); //change to your attribute code<br>
} catch(Exception $e) {<br>
echo $_id .”:”. $e-&gt;getMessage() .”\n”;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
fclose($handle);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Run the file, it will take time to complete depending on how many values you had for that attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.)</strong> Clear cache, Re-index the indexes.</p>
<p>Done!<br>
Test it thoroughly.<br>
Based on my Magento Stackexchange question: <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/6707/convert-attribute-type-from-text-to-dropdown/6710">http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/6707/convert-attribute-type-from-text-to-dropdown/6710</a></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, removing live orders is not recommended. But if you are sure you want to remove orders (test orders?) then you can do so by custom script below. Get the order increment id(s) of the order you wish to delete from Magento. Remember, once order is deleted you can’t get any related information of that order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create a test PHP file in your Magento project root with below code:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}require ‘app/Mage.php’;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Mage::app(‘admin’)-&amp;gt;setUseSessionInUrl(false);&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Create a test PHP file in your Magento project root with below code:<br>

Mage::app(‘admin’)-&gt;setUseSessionInUrl(false);</p>
<p>$orderIncrementIDs = array(‘100000001′,’100000002’); //your order increment ids to delete, beware!<br>
$rmvd = array();</p>
<p>foreach($orderIncrementIDs as $ordID){<br>
try{<br>
Mage::getModel(‘sales/order’)-&gt;loadByIncrementId($ordID)-&gt;delete();<br>
$rmvd[] = $ordID;<br>
} catch(Exception $e){<br>
echo ‘Error: ‘.$e-&gt;getMessage().’<br>
‘;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
echo “Following Orders Removed!<br>
” . implode(“, “,$rmvd);{/code}<br>
and run the file to delete the order(s).</p>
<p>You can also delete orders directly from database using below query:<br>
{code type=sql}select @order_id:=entity_id from sales_order_entity where increment_id=’100000001′;<br>
delete from sales_order_entity where entity_id=@order_id or parent_id=@order_id;{/code}</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get all the categories a product belongs to in Magento. Below code will get you all the categories with details the product is attached to.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redirection in observer doesn’t work normally as it do in Blocks, templates and controllers. Also there is no standard code to redirect from observer that works in every situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will need an argument to achieve redirect when using below code:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}public function observingMethod(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$observer-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;setParam(‘return_url’,$urlToRedirect);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Note that $observer object should have getRequest() method to make above code work. You may need to use $observer-&amp;gt;getEvent()-&amp;gt;getFront()-&amp;gt;getRequest() otherwise, or simply var_dump/Mage::log $observer to get better idea what methods the object have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get a list of all orphaned products which are not associated with any category in Magento. Sometimes you may have missed to select categories for products by mistake when filling new product details, and now want to list them and assign categories to those products. You can’t get it from the Magento admin screen so you will need to run below MySQL query to get all the products without categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Above sql query will simply bring the product ID, SKU, Name of products where category is NULL. You can add more columns in select (like e.*) to list full details of products.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mysql LIKE clause match exact whole word only while searching. Search the words with space in mysql database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to search for exact word using LIKE clause, you can’t do it just using percentage (%) sign around the keyword as it will search for partial words too. For example, the below query will match all the words which contain “some”:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=sql}SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname LIKE ‘%some%’;{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mysql LIKE clause match exact whole word only while searching. Search the words with space in mysql database.</p>
<p>If you want to search for exact word using LIKE clause, you can’t do it just using percentage (%) sign around the keyword as it will search for partial words too. For example, the below query will match all the words which contain “some”:</p>
<p>{code type=sql}SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname LIKE ‘%some%’;{/code}</p>
<p>It will find all the instances where it finds <em>some</em>, as a whole or a part. some, someone, something, handsome, isometric are all MATCHED using above query. Ofcourse there will be many results which are UNRELATED.</p>
<p>But what if you only want <em>some</em>, as an exact word WITH space and WITHOUT any extra heading and trailing characters?</p>
<p>This query will do exactly that:</p>
<p>{code type=sql}SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname = ‘some’ OR columnname LIKE ‘% some’ OR columnname LIKE ‘some %’ OR columnname LIKE ‘% some %’;{/code}</p>
<p>In above query we are making sure that all the <em>some</em> instances are retrieved, whether they are present in the START or in the END or in the MIDDLE of the columnname field.</p>

It’s little difficult to make it work on your system as there are some issues which occurs in installing it, and there is also no thorough documentation as of now. It’s in pre-alpha release and just publicly available since 3 weeks. I will show you how to install OroCRM assuming you have Linux system.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: Symfony 2, Doctrine 2, PHP &gt;= 5.3.3</p>
<p><img src="http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/orocrm-login.png" alt="OroCRM login - installation guide"></p>
<p>– Clone the CRM application Git repository in your local. It should be done in your web server’s root directory (e.g. /var/www/).<br>
{code}git clone <a href="http://gitlab.orocrm.com/crm-application.git%7B/code%7D">http://gitlab.orocrm.com/crm-application.git{/code}</a></p>
<p>– Now switch to the newly created crm-application directory and make the parameters.yml file with your configuration changes.<br>
{code}cd crm-application<br>
cp app/config/parameters.dist.yml app/config/parameters.yml<br>
vi app/config/parameters.yml{/code}</p>
<p>– Edit composer.json, add symfony/assestic-bundle to prevent future error:</p>
<p><em>PHP Fatal error: Class ‘Assetic\Util\PathUtils’ not found in /var/www/crm-application/vendor/symfony/assetic-bundle/Symfony/Bundle/AsseticBundle/Command/DumpCommand.php on line 216</em></p>
<p>{code}replace:<br>
“require”: {<br>
“php”: “&gt;=5.3.3”,<br>
“oro/platform”: “dev-master”,<br>
“oro/crm”: “dev-master”<br>
},{/code}<br>
with<br>
{code}”require”: {<br>
“php”: “&gt;=5.3.3”,<br>
“oro/platform”: “dev-master”,<br>
“oro/crm”: “dev-master”,<br>
“symfony/assetic-bundle”: “2.3.*@dev”<br>
},{/code}</p>
<p>– This will install composer. If you already have it, just ignore this step.<br>
{code}curl -s <a href="https://getcomposer.org/installer">https://getcomposer.org/installer</a> | php{/code}</p>
<p>– This will install all the things which are listed in composer.json file and necessary by Oro; like zendframework, doctrine, twig, symfony, monolog, oro, etc..<br>
{code}php composer.phar install –prefer-dist{/code}</p>
<p>Change permissions of cache and logs directory to world-writeable. Otherwise you will get errors like:</p>
<p><em>PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception ‘RuntimeException’ with message ‘Unable to write in the logs directory (/var/www/crm-application/app/logs)\n’ in …<br>
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught exception ‘RuntimeException’ with message ‘Unable to create the cache directory (/var/www/crm-application/app/cache/prod)\n’ in …</em></p>
<p>{code}chmod -R 777 app/cache<br>
chmod -R 777 app/logs<br>
or, find app/cache app/logs -type d -exec chmod 777 {} +{/code}</p>
<p>– Finally, run the install bash script<br>
{code}./install.sh{/code}</p>
<p>You should now able to see the login screen of OroCRM if everything went good. If you face any error, check below errors and how to solve it.</p>
<p><em>Login credentials are:</em><br>
username: admin<br>
password: admin</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get attribute options list i.e. label and value, if the attribute type is dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post will show you how to get all the options of attribute with dropdown type in Magento. If your attribute has options, below code will give all the attribute options labels and values in an array format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=php}$attribute = Mage::getSingleton(‘eav/config’)-&amp;gt;getAttribute(‘catalog_product’, ‘shirt_size’); //change shirt_size to your attribute code&lt;br&gt;&#xA;if ($attribute-&amp;gt;usesSource()) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$options = $attribute-&amp;gt;getSource()-&amp;gt;getAllOptions(false);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;foreach($options as $option) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;print_r($option);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get attribute options list i.e. label and value, if the attribute type is dropdown.</p>
<p>This post will show you how to get all the options of attribute with dropdown type in Magento. If your attribute has options, below code will give all the attribute options labels and values in an array format.</p>
<p>{code type=php}$attribute = Mage::getSingleton(‘eav/config’)-&gt;getAttribute(‘catalog_product’, ‘shirt_size’); //change shirt_size to your attribute code<br>
if ($attribute-&gt;usesSource()) {<br>
$options = $attribute-&gt;getSource()-&gt;getAllOptions(false);<br>
foreach($options as $option) {<br>
print_r($option);<br>
}<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>In the above code, first line will initialize the attribute. Then we are checking if the attribute is using source model or not, if using then get all the options of that attribute.</p>
<p>It will output this for attribute shirt_size:</p>
<p>{code type=plain}Array<br>
(<br>
[value] =&gt; 100<br>
[label] =&gt; Small<br>
)<br>
Array<br>
(<br>
[value] =&gt; 99<br>
[label] =&gt; Medium<br>
)<br>
Array<br>
(<br>
[value] =&gt; 98<br>
[label] =&gt; Large<br>
){/code}</p>
<p>If you are here to get attribute option’s label from value OR get attribute option’s value from label, just check out this post: <a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2012/09/13/magento-get-product-attribute-select-option-idlabelvalue/">http://ka.lpe.sh/2012/09/13/magento-get-product-attribute-select-option-idlabelvalue/</a></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To get product attribute value in Magento is very common. You will need it everytime when dealing with catalog products in your development. Attributes have different types, which can be any of Text Field, Text Area, Date, Yes/No, Multiple Select, Dropdown, Price, Gallery, Media Image, Fixed Product Tax (as you can see in backend &lt;em&gt;Manage Attributes &amp;gt; New Attribute &amp;gt; Catalog Input Type for Store Owner&lt;/em&gt;). To get the value for these different types of attributes there is no one straight line of code, you will need to use different code for getting values from plain attributes, while different code to get values from select and multiselect attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To get attribute label for the product in Magento is not that straight-forward as we do for getting attribute value. You will need attribute code and product object to get the attribute label as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have the product object, you can use it to get the attribute’s label..&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$label = $product-&amp;gt;getResource()-&amp;gt;getAttribute($attribute_code)-&amp;gt;getFrontend()-&amp;gt;getLabel($product);{/code}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the current/selected store view..&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$label = $product-&amp;gt;getResource()-&amp;gt;getAttribute($attribute_code)-&amp;gt;getStoreLabel();{/code}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will output you the label of the attribute associated with the attribute code you passed for that product. E.g. Shirt Size, Color, etc..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PHP redirect without header()</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s very frustrating when you want to redirect from one page to another, and you get the error:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent by (output started at /some/filename.php:12) in /some/filename.php on line 99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is Headers are already sent, or in simple language the output is already sent to browser when your header() function is called. The best solution is not to pass headers (send html/output to browser) till the point header() function is fired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s very frustrating when you want to redirect from one page to another, and you get the error:</p>
<p><em>Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent by (output started at /some/filename.php:12) in /some/filename.php on line 99</em></p>
<p>The problem is Headers are already sent, or in simple language the output is already sent to browser when your header() function is called. The best solution is not to pass headers (send html/output to browser) till the point header() function is fired.</p>
<p>Another way is to use output buffering. Without output buffering (the default), your HTML is sent to the browser in pieces as PHP processes through your script. With output buffering, your HTML is stored in a variable and sent to the browser as one piece at the end of your script. For using this method, you have to start your file with <em>ob_start();</em> so that output gets buffered.</p>
<p>But what if you don’t care whether the output is sent or not, you anyway want the redirect to work? This simple function will do the trick for you. It will check if headers are not sent, then it will call the PHP’s header function to redirect. But if the headers are sent, it will use Javascript to redirect to the URL you want.</p>
<p>{code type=php}function redirect($url)<br>
{<br>
if (!headers_sent())<br>
{<br>
header(‘Location: ‘.$url);<br>
exit;<br>
}<br>
else<br>
{<br>
echo ‘<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;;
echo &lsquo;window.location.href=&quot;&rsquo;.$url.&rsquo;&quot;;&rsquo;;
echo &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘;<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OroCRM is an open-source Client Relationship Management tool founded in 2012 by Yoav Kutner, previous CTO and co-founder of Magento AND Jary Carter, former VP of Sales and Channel of Magento. Dima Soroka, who was Lead Architect for Magento is the VP of Engineering in Oro Inc. With such industry leaders, OroCRM is believed to be the next big CRM for many e-commerce frameworks. Personally I like this CRM because there are no good CRM available in PHP which can seamlessly integrate with Magento and offer flexibility that clients need. OroCRM is aimed to deal with these issues where it will offer flexible needs, reporting and marketing tools for multi-channel commerce.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>These are created as they are very commonly used, to make developer’s life easier.</p>
<h2 id="-function">$() Function</h2>
<p>– Retuns the element that has the ID passed as an argument<br>
<em>Shorthand to</em>: document.getElementById()<br>
Example:<br>
{code type=javascript}<br>
$(“car”); //returns element having id “car”<br>
$(“car”).hide(); //hides div where id is “car”<br>
$(“car”).addClassName(“hidden”); //adds class name “hidden” to element with id “car”<br>
{/code}</p>
<h2 id="-function-1">$$() Function</h2>
<p>– Returns the elements that has CSS selectors as an argument<br>
<em>Shorthand to</em>: document.getElementById() + document.getElementsByTagName() + prototype’s getElementsByClassName()<br>
Example:<br>
{code type=javascript}<br>
$$(‘.active’);//returns all the elements having class “active”<br>
$$(‘div.active p, #car a’).invoke(‘hide’); //hides all the “p” tags under div having class “active”, hides all links under element having id “car”<br>
$$(‘div:empty’); //all divs without any content, version 1.5.1 and above<br>
{/code}</p>
<h2 id="f-function">$F() Function</h2>
<p>– Returns the value of a form control, like text boxes or dropdown options<br>
<em>Shorthand to</em>: Form.Element.getValue, Form.Element#getValue<br>
{code type=html}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="r-function">$R() Function</h2>
<p>– Builds a range object, shorthand to “new ObjectRange()”<br>
<em>Shorthand to</em>: ObjectRange()<br>
Example:<br>
{code type=javascript}<br>
var range = $R(10, 20, false);<br>
range.each(function(value, index){<br>
alert(value);<br>
});<br>
{/code}</p>
<h2 id="h-function">$H() Function</h2>
<p>– Converts objects into enumerable Hash objects which resembles associate arrays.<br>
<em>Shorthand to</em>: Hash<br>
{code type=javascript}<br>
var a = {<br>
firstname: ‘John’,<br>
lastname: ‘Doe’<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will help you to differentiate between javascript’s &lt;em&gt;return false&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;preventDefault&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;stopPropagation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stopImmediatePropagation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you learn when using javascript is to use &lt;em&gt;return false&lt;/em&gt;. That’s the best thing we think to cancel browser’s default behavior, to stop further execution of an event. If you are using a simple function which returns what you want, then probably you won’t notice anything wrong in using &lt;em&gt;return false&lt;/em&gt;. But when you want event to propagate, &lt;em&gt;return false&lt;/em&gt; will not be helpful and will give unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post will help you to differentiate between javascript’s <em>return false</em>, <em>preventDefault</em>, <em>stopPropagation</em> and <em>stopImmediatePropagation</em>.</p>
<p>The first thing you learn when using javascript is to use <em>return false</em>. That’s the best thing we think to cancel browser’s default behavior, to stop further execution of an event. If you are using a simple function which returns what you want, then probably you won’t notice anything wrong in using <em>return false</em>. But when you want event to propagate, <em>return false</em> will not be helpful and will give unexpected result.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-event-propagation">What is event propagation?</h2>
<p>When a single event, such as a mouse click, if is handled by two or more event handlers defined in various location of the DOM hiearachy, then the event handling starts by executing for individual elements at the lowest level. There are two models of this event propagation, <em>event bubbling</em> and <em>event capturing</em>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event bubbling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is when an event has more than one event handler and event handling execution starts from <strong>bottom to top</strong> i.e. from individual links to it’s parent element (e.g. form or body or document) having it’s own event handler.</p>
<p>{code type=html}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On clicking on the link in the above example code, first the hyperlink’s event will be handled, then form’s event will get handled, and at last body’s event will get handled. This is event bubbling, which bubble up from bottom to top.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Event capturing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is opposite to event bubbling, where event handling execution starts from <strong>top to bottom</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have such type of architecture, where there are many event handlers for an event, you should not use <em>return false</em> or atleast use it with caution. It can get you in big trouble, as it does <em>preventDefault()</em> and <em>stopPropagation()</em> both and hence never allows further execution of an event.</p>
<h2 id="preventdefault">preventDefault()</h2>
<p>It simply stops the default action of an element. Example, prevents the hyperlink from following the URL, prevents the submit button to submit the form. When you have many event handlers and you just want to prevent default event from occuring, just use <em>e.preventDefault()</em> in the top of the function definition. The reason we put <em>preventDefault()</em> in the first line of function is because, if something goes wrong in the code following the <em>preventDefault()</em>, then also it will not allow link or form to get submitted or do whatever action you want it to do. And hence the link or submit button will get submitted. It will still allow further propagation of the event.</p>
<p>Following example prevents the link from following the URL given in href attribute.<br>
{code type=html}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>{/code}</p>
<h2 id="stoppropagation">stopPropagation()</h2>
<p>{code type=html}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="stopimmediatepropagation">stopImmediatePropagation()</h2>
<p>If you have multiple event handlers for the event, and you want to stop all other event handlers and current event also from further executing, you should use <em>stopImmediatePropagation()</em>.<br>
{code type=html}</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>$(&ldquo;div a&rdquo;).click(function (e) { alert(&lsquo;Hi! You can see me&rsquo;); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); });</p>
<p>$(&ldquo;div a&rdquo;).click(function () { alert(&lsquo;I will never popup :(&rsquo;); });</p>
<p>{/code}</p>
<p>So next time when you use <em>return false</em>, think twice do you really want return false or <em>e.preventDefault()</em> or other methods explained above will well-suited there.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to use different javascript libraries in the same page. Because they tend to create conflicts with each other’s code, and often break javascript. One such case is using jQuery and PrototypeJS libraries in the same webpage. Both prototypejs and jquery use $ as their function or variable name which causes issues, as both the libraries will get triggered with that alias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;jQuery provides a method which solves this issue, so that you can use any javascript library with jQuery on the same page. This function is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/&#34;&gt;noConflict()&lt;/a&gt;, and it simply uses different symbol/charater(s) you provide rather than dollar ($).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you want to lookup the checkbox by &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;id&lt;/em&gt;, just replace &lt;em&gt;#yourCheckboxID&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;.yourCheckboxClassName&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=javascript}if($(‘#yourCheckboxID’).is(‘:checked’)) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;//do whatever you want here, checkbox is checked&lt;br&gt;&#xA;} else {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;//do whatever you want here, checkbox is NOT checked&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/jquery-logo.png" alt="jQuery javascript framework">Using jQuery, check whether checkbox is checked or not using 4 different ways in this post.</p>
<p>Below code relies on jQuery’s <a href="http://api.jquery.com/is/" title="jQuery is method">is</a> method to check if the checkbox is checked or not. If you want to lookup the checkbox by <em>class</em> instead of <em>id</em>, just replace <em>#yourCheckboxID</em> with <em>.yourCheckboxClassName</em></p>
<p>{code type=javascript}if($(‘#yourCheckboxID’).is(‘:checked’)) {<br>
//do whatever you want here, checkbox is checked<br>
} else {<br>
//do whatever you want here, checkbox is NOT checked<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Other alternative to check same thing:<br>
{code type=javascript}$(‘#yourCheckboxID’).change(function() {<br>
if(this.checked) {<br>
//checkbox is checked<br>
} else {<br>
//checkbox is NOT checked<br>
}<br>
});{/code}<br>
Above code is the better way and my favorite. It will simply observe the checkbox and when it’s “changed”, the above function will get triggered. Once triggered, it will check the changed object’s (checkbox) attribute “checked”. If it finds the attribute is set, then returns true otherwise returns false.</p>
<p>Third way of doing it is:<br>
{code type=javascript}if($(‘#yourCheckboxID’).attr(‘checked’) {<br>
//checkbox is checked<br>
} else {<br>
//checkbox is NOT checked<br>
}{/code}<br>
Above code will check the checkbox’s attribute “checked”, if present it will give true and if not present, it will give false.</p>
<p>Since jQuery 1.6, the new method has been introduced which is called <a href="http://api.jquery.com/prop/" title="jQuery prop method">prop</a>. If you are using jQuery 1.6 or above, you can use following code to check if checkbox is checked or not:<br>
{code type=javascript}if($(‘#yourCheckboxID’).prop(‘checked’)) {<br>
//checkbox is checked<br>
} else {<br>
//checkbox is NOT checked<br>
}{/code}</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get all the products with status equal to enabled/disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using Flat Catalog in Magento, you will not get disabled products by this filter as in flat table all the products are only enabled one. You can check if your Magento website uses flat catalog or not by going here:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Admin &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Configuration &amp;gt; Catalog section &amp;gt; Catalog &amp;gt; Frontend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;em&gt;Use Flat Catalog Category&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Use Flat Catalog Product&lt;/em&gt;, if they are &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; it means you are using flat catalog, if they are &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; it means you are NOT using flat catalog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get all the products with status equal to enabled/disabled.</p>
<p>If you are using Flat Catalog in Magento, you will not get disabled products by this filter as in flat table all the products are only enabled one. You can check if your Magento website uses flat catalog or not by going here:<br>
<em>Admin &gt; System &gt; Configuration &gt; Catalog section &gt; Catalog &gt; Frontend</em></p>
<p>Check <em>Use Flat Catalog Category</em> and <em>Use Flat Catalog Product</em>, if they are <em>Yes</em> it means you are using flat catalog, if they are <em>No</em> it means you are NOT using flat catalog.</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have flat catalog enabled and you want to filter all the products with status equal to disabled, you can use below code:</p>
<p>{code type=php}$products = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/category’)-&gt;load($category_id)<br>
-&gt;getProductCollection()<br>
-&gt;addAttributeToSelect(‘*’) //whatever attributes you want to get here<br>
-&gt;addAttributeToFilter(<br>
‘status’,<br>
array(‘eq’ =&gt; Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Status::STATUS_DISABLED)<br>
//replace DISABLED to ENABLED for products with status enabled<br>
);{/code}</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your Magento site is slow, then one of the reason can be because of Catalog URL Rewrites. You can check in the Magento Admin &amp;gt; Catalog &amp;gt; URL Rewrite Management. If you see the catalog rewrites are very large than expected as per total Categories and Products you have, this will create your site to be slow. This generally gets too large if you edit the categories/products and change it’s URL. Generally we keep on changing the product URL to optimize for search engines or to correct some typo in the link. Magento saves all the previous category and product URLs even if it is changed many times, resulting in more number of URL rewrites in database. I have seen in one of the project, where total SKUs were near to 4,00,000 while the URL Rewrites were near to 46,00,000 with just one website and store!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
– First step is ofcourse, to take the backup of table core_url_rewrite<br>
If something goes wrong then we can restore our old core_url_rewrite table to bring it back.</p>
<p>– Now truncate the table core_url_rewrite<br>
<em>truncate table core_url_rewrite</em> in your Mysql console or from phpMyAdmin to empty this table.</p>
<p>– Re-index “Catalog URL Rewrite” from Index Management<br>
This will create all the URL rewrites (current URLs only) for your categories and products and insert it into core_url_rewrite table.</p>

If you are using apache as your web server on Linux, you can check it by going to &lt;em&gt;/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load&lt;/em&gt;, if rewrite.load is present there it means your rewrite module is enabled. If not, you will need to copy &lt;em&gt;rewrite.load&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;/etc/apache2/mods-available/&lt;/em&gt; and paste it at &lt;em&gt;/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/&lt;/em&gt; location.

<p>Make sure your web server rewrite module is enabled. If you are using apache as your web server on Linux, you can check it by going to <em>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load</em>, if rewrite.load is present there it means your rewrite module is enabled. If not, you will need to copy <em>rewrite.load</em> from <em>/etc/apache2/mods-available/</em> and paste it at <em>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/</em> location. Then reload the apache by running <em>service apache2 reload</em>.</p>
<p>2.) Check the file permission of .htaccess, it should be present in Magento root directory and readable by server.</p>

      <title>Magento clone collection &amp;#8211; How to clone collection in Magento</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clone collection in Magento in an easy and effective way. Cloning collection in Magento is not as straight forward as we do in PHP object cloning. That’s because Magento does not implement clone in it’s collection object, which is why if you try to clone Magento collection it will nothing but just a copy of the original collection itself. If the original collection gets updated, this cloned will also get updated, which is what we don’t want right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clone collection in Magento in an easy and effective way. Cloning collection in Magento is not as straight forward as we do in PHP object cloning. That’s because Magento does not implement clone in it’s collection object, which is why if you try to clone Magento collection it will nothing but just a copy of the original collection itself. If the original collection gets updated, this cloned will also get updated, which is what we don’t want right?</p>
<p>Let’s see an example where PHP’s clone keyword will fail. Consider you have an $collection in the class method and you want to perform operations on this $collection in two different ways. So you need to clone this $collection and perform operation differently in both the collections so that both collections have different result set.</p>
<p>{code type=php}$coll1 = clone $collection;<br>
$coll2 = clone $collection;{/code}</p>
<p>Let’s perform different operations on these two separate collections now, like this:</p>
<p>{code type=php}$coll1-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;where(‘first where condition’);<br>
$coll2-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;where(‘second where condition’);<br>
if($coll1-&gt;getSize() == 0) {<br>
$collection = $coll2;<br>
} else {<br>
$collection = $coll1;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>But this will fail and not work what we expect here. $collection here will hold BOTH the where conditions, instead of any one depending on the result of IF condition.</p>
<p>To overcome this, in Magento, what you have to do is:</p>
<p>{code type=php}//Assuming you have original collection as $collection<br>
$collection-&gt;getSelect()<br>
-&gt;joinLeft(‘table1 as table1alias’, ‘table1alias.entity_id=e.entity_id’,array(‘name’,’description’))<br>
-&gt;where(‘$firstWhereCondition’);</p>
<p>$coll = clone $collection;<br>
if($coll-&gt;getSize() == 0) {<br>
$fromPart = $collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::FROM); //getting all the FROM clause from collection<br>
$wherePart = $collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::WHERE); //getting all the WHERE clause conditions from collection<br>
//debug to see what you have to remove<br>
//print_r($fromPart);print_r($wherePart);exit;</p>
<p>unset($fromPart[‘table1alias’]); //removing table1 join which we did for first where condition<br>
unset($wherePart[0]); //removing first where condition, this may be different based on your query</p>
<p>//removed FROM and first WHERE condition from collection<br>
$collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;setPart(Zend_Db_Select::FROM, $fromPart);<br>
$collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;setPart(Zend_Db_Select::WHERE, $wherePart);</p>
<p>//now assign FROM and second WHERE condition to collection<br>
$collection-&gt;getSelect()<br>
-&gt;joinLeft(‘table1 as table1alias’, ‘table1alias.entity_id=e.entity_id’,array(‘name’,’description’))<br>
-&gt;where($secondWhereCondition);</p>
<p>//echo $collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;__toString();</p>
<p>}<br>
echo $collection-&gt;getSize();{/code}</p>
<p>That’s it! You have just used one collection and applied two where conditions. Similarly you can even apply multiple FROM and WHERE clause conditions as per the requirement.</p>
<p>HTH!</p>

<p>When migrating Magento site from old server to new server, this error often occurs and appears in var/log/system.log. It prevents your Magento Admin to load JS and CSS files hence your admin panel becomes skinless.</p>
<p>The solution to get rid of this and load JS and CSS files is to run the following mysql commands in Mysql console or phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>{code type=sql}SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;<br>
UPDATE <code>core\_store</code> SET store_id = 0 WHERE code=’admin’;<br>
UPDATE <code>core\_store\_group</code> SET group_id = 0 WHERE name=’Default’;<br>
UPDATE <code>core\_website</code> SET website_id = 0 WHERE code=’admin’;<br>
UPDATE <code>customer\_group</code> SET customer_group_id = 0 WHERE customer_group_code=’NOT LOGGED IN’;<br>
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;{/code}</p>
<p>What the above mysql commands does is:<br>
– Disables foreign key checks on tables so that you don’t get any foreign key errors while executing immediate update queries.<br>
– Updates store, store_group and website tables with ID = 0, for admin user</p>
<p>Once the above set of queries are executed, don’t forget to <strong>clear cache</strong> to reflect your changes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know that Pinterest is very popular and a great tool for marketing variety of products. It can give you huge traffic to your website resulting in incredible sales and revenue. It have almost all types of categories to hold your pinned images so that your product gets noticed to potential customers. It even has an option to specify the price of the product, which only gives you interested buyers to your website.</p>
<p><img src="http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Magento-Pinterest-AutoPin.jpg" alt="Magento Pinterest Auto Pin product images by Magentools"></p>
<p>If you have hundreds/thousands of products in your store and want to pin it on Pinterest it becomes very difficult, as Pinterest don’t provide multiple pinning of images. One by one pinning images is a nightmare if you have lots of products. There is also no official Pinterest API which can allow you to auto-pin your images through some kind of API.</p>
<p>If you are using Magento as your e-commerce framework, there’s a good news for you! There is an extension available at Magentools.com which gives you ability to auto-pin hundreds of product images in just one click! Other options includes to pin image with your Product Name, SKU and Price along with your product link on your website. This extension, called as Pinterest Auto Pin multiple images plugin acts as a bridge between your Magento store and Pinterest. In your Magento admin panel’s “Manage Products” screen, you can see the option Pin To Board which loads all your Pinterest boards you want the product images to pin into! It also allows you to pin the individual product image pin when you create new product / edit existing product, by clicking on the tab “MagenTools” and selecting your desired Pinterest Board before saving the product.</p>
<p>It’s the must-have extension for the e-Commerce company which is more focused into marketing their products online and want more potential customers. You can find more details on the Pinterest Auto-Pin API extension here: <a href="http://magext.com/work/magento-social-network-auto-poster/" title="MagenTools Pinterest Auto Pin API">http://magext.com/work/magento-social-network-auto-poster/</a></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding custom attribute to order in Magento is same as we do for customer and category. The difference is we will use different setup class AND we will not need attribute set, group and attribute input type now. We will create a quick module which will do exactly what we want and nothing more than that. So let’s start our new module.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.) Create a file at app/etc/modules/ and name it whatever you want. I will name it Namespace_Module.xml&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Paste this code in that file:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=xml}&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The difference is we will use different setup class AND we will not need attribute set, group and attribute input type now. We will create a quick module which will do exactly what we want and nothing more than that. So let’s start our new module.</p>
<p>1.) Create a file at app/etc/modules/ and name it whatever you want. I will name it Namespace_Module.xml<br>
Paste this code in that file:<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>2.) Create necessary directories to reach to app/code/local/Namespace/Module/etc/, so that we can create our config.xml there. Paste below code in this config file:<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>3.) Now comes our main file, which will create new Order attribute for us. Create file “mysql4-install-0.0.1.php” in app/code/local/Namespace/Module/sql/module_setup/, and paste the below code in it:<br>
{code type=php}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
startSetup();<br>
$this-&gt;addAttribute(‘order’, ‘your_custom_attribute_here’, array(<br>
‘type’ =&gt; ‘varchar’,<br>
‘label’ =&gt; ‘Custom Order attribute label’,<br>
‘visible’ =&gt; true,<br>
‘required’ =&gt; false,<br>
‘visible_on_front’ =&gt; true,<br>
‘user_defined’ =&gt; true<br>
));</p>
<p>$this-&gt;endSetup();{/code}</p>
<p>This will add new attribute to Order and after clearing cache you can see your custom attribute in backend “Manage Orders” screen and in customer frontend screen “My Orders”. HTH!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding category attribute in Magento is same as we add for product and customer. Here in this post I will create a custom module which will add your new custom category attribute in Magento. So let’s start with the module:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1.) As usual, create an XML file in app/etc/modules/ directory, I will name it Namespace_Module.xml&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Paste below code in it changing the Namespace and Module as you want.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=xml}&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Paste below code in it changing the Namespace and Module as you want.<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>2.) Second step would be to create a file config.xml in app/code/local/Namespace/Module/etc/ directory. Create all the directories required get there. Paste the below code in it making sure you have changed Namespace and Module with your naming.<br>
{code type=php}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>3.) Here comes main file, which will actually add attribute to category. We will put below code in app/code/local/Namespace/Module/sql/module_setup/mysql4-install-0.1.0.php<br>
{code type=php}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
startSetup();<br>
$this-&gt;addAttribute(‘catalog_category’, ‘your_custom_attribute_here’, array(<br>
‘group’ =&gt; ‘General’,<br>
‘input’ =&gt; ‘text’,<br>
‘type’ =&gt; ‘varchar’,<br>
‘label’ =&gt; ‘Custom Category attribute label’,<br>
‘visible’ =&gt; true,<br>
‘required’ =&gt; false,<br>
‘visible_on_front’ =&gt; true,<br>
‘global’ =&gt; Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource_Eav_Attribute::SCOPE_GLOBAL,<br>
));</p>
<p>$this-&gt;endSetup();<br>
?&gt;{/code}</p>
<p>We have used minimal things to create this module and add attribute to category. You can go further and do more additions from this.</p>
<p>After clearing cache, you will see that your new custom attribute appear in Category pages in frontend as well as Manage Categories section in backend. HTH!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento to add an attribute to customer is not an option in the admin panel like it does have for Product attribute. So you have to end up writing the script that will add your custom attribute in customer’s EAV tables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below code will insert your custom customer attribute in Magento system. You can even specify whil creating the attribute whether that attribute should appear in the forms (like register/signup) or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>{code type=php}$installer = $this;<br>

<p>$entityTypeId = $setup-&gt;getEntityTypeId(‘customer’);<br>
$attributeSetId = $setup-&gt;getDefaultAttributeSetId($entityTypeId);<br>
$attributeGroupId = $setup-&gt;getDefaultAttributeGroupId($entityTypeId, $attributeSetId);</p>
<p>$setup-&gt;addAttribute(‘customer’, ‘your_attribute_code_here’, array(<br>
‘input’ =&gt; ‘text’, //or select or whatever you like<br>
‘type’ =&gt; ‘int’, //or varchar or anything you want it<br>
‘label’ =&gt; ‘Attribute description goes here’,<br>
‘visible’ =&gt; 1,<br>
‘required’ =&gt; 0, //mandatory? then 1<br>

<p>$oAttribute = Mage::getSingleton(‘eav/config’)-&gt;getAttribute(‘customer’, ‘your_attribute_code_here’);<br>
$oAttribute-&gt;setData(‘used_in_forms’, array(‘adminhtml_customer’));<br>
$oAttribute-&gt;save();</p>
<p>$setup-&gt;endSetup();{/code}</p>
<p>Here we have used our custom attribute’s:<br>
– <em>input</em> type as <em>text</em>, but you can have it anything you like to appear in the form. It can be textarea, date, select or anything you want.<br>
– data <em>type</em> as <em>int</em>, but you can have it anything from text, datetime, varchar or decimal. Remember customer is EAV in Magento, so it needs this information to store all the future values of this attribute in customer_entity_int (customer_entity_*) table.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento special price products page. We will be creating a new CMS page that will display all the Special or Sale products. We can make a product as a Special by filling it’s “Special From” and “Special To” price in “Prices” tab in Manage Products individual screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let’s first create CMS Page, by going to CMS &amp;gt; Pages, which we will name it as “Specials”. In the Content tab of that Page, paste the below line of code:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code}{{block type=”catalog/product_special” template=”catalog/product/list.phtml” column_count=”3″ num_products=”0″}}{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and save the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Magento needs PDO Mysql extension for database connection and related things, so if you don’t have pdo_mysql extension enabled Magento will complain about this and will not proceed further installation. If you are not sure what PDO is, it’s high time for you to look at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php">http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php</a></p>
<p>Coming back to error, to resolve this you will need to edit your php.ini file where it says:<br>
;extension=pdo_mysql.so</p>
<p>Just uncomment the line by removing front semincolon, so it becomes<br>
extension=pdo_mysql.so</p>
<p>Save it and restart the server, the error should go.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows, then that line should read:</p>
<p>extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll</p>
<p>If you don’t find pdo_mysql in php.ini, <strong>install</strong> php5-mysql by running the command:</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install php5-mysql (on Ubuntu)</p>
<p>sudo yum install php-mysql (on Redhat, Fedora, CentOS)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to allow your customers to order for sample of any product, before purchasing the actual product, it becomes very tough as in a product page you can’t have two products (sample + full) allowed.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While importing products (somewhere around 1200 rows) by Magento’s in-built “System &amp;gt; Import/Export &amp;gt; Dataflow – Profiles” I got an error where the Dashboard’s HTML was printed in the output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ka.lpe.sh/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/import_error.png&#34; alt=&#34;magento product import error&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this error is due to something wrong in CSV product data which Magento didn’t understand. Create a temporary CSV file with only few rows (2-4) and check if that works. If it works, that means there is some problem with rest of the data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Magento: Reset download limit for downloadable product item/order</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento, downloadable products are the products which can be downloaded and does not require any shipping. When customer purchases this type of products, they get certain download limits to download their purchased items. This can be set in Products page in admin under “Downloadable Products” tab. In many cases store owner only want to give certain amount of downloads, so customers can’t download beyond that limit. But it may happen that due to bad internet or some interrupts downloads can’t be successful and customer want to reset that limit. For doing this, there is no option in backend to reset the download limits for the downloadable product items or for an entire order, and unfortunately admin use to re-order to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For doing this, there is no option in backend to reset the download limits for the downloadable product items or for an entire order, and unfortunately admin use to re-order to achieve this.</p>
<p>Here is the query which will reset download limits for an entire order.<br>
{code type=php}$q = Mage::getModel(‘sales/order_item’)-&gt;getCollection()-&gt;addFieldToSelect(‘order_id’);<br>
$q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;joinRight(‘downloadable_link_purchased_item as d’, ‘main_table.item_id = d.order_item_id’,<br>
array(‘item_id’,’number_of_downloads_used’));<br>
$q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;where(‘main_table.order_id = ‘. (int)$orderId);<br>
$q-&gt;load();</p>
<p>//echo $q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;__toString();exit;</p>
<p>$items = $q-&gt;getColumnValues(‘item_id’);<br>
foreach($items as $id) {<br>
Mage::getModel(‘downloadable/link_purchased_item’)-&gt;load($id)<br>
-&gt;setStatus(‘available’)-&gt;setNumberOfDownloadsUsed(0)-&gt;save();<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>The raw SQL query for the above Magento Convention query is:<br>
UPDATE sales_flat_order_item s RIGHT JOIN downloadable_link_purchased_item d ON s.item_id = d.order_item_id SET d.number_of_downloads_used = 0 WHERE s.order_id = $orderId;</p>
<p>Here is another query that will allow you to reset download limits for a particular item in an order<br>
{code type=php}$q = Mage::getModel(‘sales/order_item’)-&gt;getCollection()-&gt;addFieldToSelect(‘order_id’);<br>
$q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;joinRight(‘downloadable_link_purchased_item as d’, ‘main_table.item_id = d.order_item_id’,<br>
array(‘item_id’,’number_of_downloads_used’));<br>
$q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;where(‘main_table.order_id = ‘. (int)$orderId .’ AND main_table.item_id = ‘. (int)$orderItemId);<br>
$q-&gt;load();</p>
<p>//echo $q-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;__toString();exit;</p>
<p>$items = $q-&gt;getColumnValues(‘item_id’);<br>
foreach($items as $id) {<br>
Mage::getModel(‘downloadable/link_purchased_item’)-&gt;load($id)<br>
-&gt;setStatus(‘available’)-&gt;setNumberOfDownloadsUsed(0)-&gt;save();<br>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Resolved]: Magento 500 internal server error<br>
If you are getting “500 Internal Server Error” then the reason might be permissions issue or fatal error.</p>
<p>In Magento, you can check the errors occured in files:<br>
var/log/system.log<br>
var/log/exception.log</p>
<p>You can even allow the error to output to your browser by editing your Magento index.php with:<br>
error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);<br>
ini_set(‘display_errors’, 1);</p>
<p>Also, try this to solve the error:<br>
– Check the owner of your magento project. It should be the server (www-data for apache)<br>
chown -R www-data:www-data .</p>
<p>– Change the directory permissions to 755 and file permissions to 644 for your project<br>
find . -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;<br>
find . -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;<br>
chmod 550 pear<br>
chmod 550 mage<br>
chmod 755 -R var</p>
<p>– Check after upgrade do you have your .htaccess file inside Magento root</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the daily commands I use at work. This will definately help someone who is not familiar with all these commands in Linux and Magento.</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Search / Replace recursively</strong></p>
<p>find /path/here/ -type f -exec sed -i ‘s/search string/replace string/g’ {} \;</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Find all files matching a string</strong></p>
<p>grep -r “string to search” /path/to/search/</p>
<p>Linux: In vi editor, copy/paste/delete/replace/insert/save/undo/redo/search-replace/goto<br>
Open file: vi filename<br>
Copy: yy (yank) (for multiple lines copy, 5yy – for copying 5 lines)<br>
Paste: p<br>
Delete: dd (for multiple lines delete, 5dd – for deleting 5 lines)<br>
Replace: r (on character you wish to replace, press r and enter new character)<br>
Insert: i or insert key<br>
Save: escape and : x (without space between : and x) (x = write and quit, w = write, q = quit, q! = quit without saving)<br>
Undo: u<br>
Redo: Ctrl+R<br>
Search: escape key THEN / THEN write string to find THEN enter<br>
Search-Replace: :%s/search string/replacement string/g<br>
Goto Line number: escape key THEN : THEN line number (e.g. :22 to go to 22nd line of current file)</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Search previous execute command in terminal</strong></p>
<p>in terminal, press Ctrl+R and type few characters.<br>
This will show you previous command matching that sequence of characters<br>
To check another command matching same characters, press Ctrl+R again</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Recursively change files/directories permissions</strong></p>
<p>find . -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;<br>
find . -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;</p>
<p>owner / read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)<br>
group / read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)<br>
world / read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Show unique values of any column in CSV</strong></p>
<p>cat file.csv | cut -f 1 -d , | sort|uniq -c | tee tempfile</p>
<p>here, 1 = 1st column, which can be changed to view any column<br>
uniq -c = unique values with count of occurences of each value. You can omit -c to just see the unique values<br>
file.csv = filename, you can have any file here with any extension<br>
, = delimiter used to separate columns<br>
tee tempfile = moves the output to file “tempfile”</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Recursively change ownership of directories/files</strong></p>
<p>chown -R www-data:www-data magento<br>
-R = for recursive<br>
www-data:www-data = change owner to www-data (apache)<br>
magento = directory to change permission for, recursively</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Remove all Magento cache files</strong></p>
<p>From your magento root in terminal, execute this:<br>
rm -rf var/cache/*<br>
DON’T put any space after cache/ and *, otherwise it will delete your WHOLE magento project 😀</p>
<p>To delete all the active sessions on your magento store,<br>
rm -rf var/session/*</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Download any Magento Extension through terminal</strong></p>
<p>./mage config-set preferred_state stable<br>
./mage clear-cache<br>
./mage sync<br>
./mage download community extension_name_here</p>
<p>for beta state, change “stable” to “beta” in the first command</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Start/Stop/Status/Restart Mysql, Apache2</strong></p>
<p>service apache2 start OR /etc/init.d/apache2 start<br>
service mysql start OR /etc/init.d/mysql start</p>
<p>replace start with stop, status, restart for respective operations</p>
<p><strong>Linux: To forcefully kill stubborn/hanged process</strong></p>
<p>In terminal, type “top” (without quotes)<br>
That will display all the processes running, just note down the process id to kill<br>
Then press key “k” and enter process id. Press enter key twice.</p>
<p><strong>Linux: Return to active terminal after remote server ssh is dead/not responding/session expired</strong></p>
<p>Press following keys to get back from remote server not responding (expired session)<br>
Enter ~ .</p>
<p><strong>Magento: Get all the methods of the class object</strong></p>
<p>Mage::log(get_class_methods(get_class($obj)));</p>
<p><strong>Magento: Testing Magento code/functionality</strong></p>
<p>Create a file in Magento root, test.php<br>
Copy this code inside it:</p>

      <title>Magento: Add product custom attribute options dynamically</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once you have the product attributes in place, and you want to add lot of options to these attributes it becomes time consuming and hectic task. If you have only few attribute options to add, it’s easy to go to backend and add manually. But if you have many attribute options, more than 10 options for many attributes, it’s very tiresome and feels like data entry job. Magento is not built to do stuff manually, so here I will provide you the code snippet which will push all the attribute options to their respective attribute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Magento is not built to do stuff manually, so here I will provide you the code snippet which will push all the attribute options to their respective attribute.</p>
<p>Create a file in the root of your Magento installation and copy this code there. I generally name it test.php<br>
{code type=php}require_once ‘app/Mage.php’;<br>
umask(0);<br>
Mage::app(‘default’);</p>
<p>$installer = new Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup(‘core_setup’);<br>
$installer-&gt;startSetup();</p>
<p>//Change this….<br>
$aColors = array(‘PINK’,’BLACK’,’BLUE’,’BROWN’,’GOLD’,’GRAY’,’GREEN’,’MULTI’,’NEUTRALS/CREAM/WHITE’,’ORANGE’,’PURPLE’,’RED’,’RUST’,’TAUPE’,’YELLOW’);<br>
$attrCode = ‘color’; //this should be there already<br>
//……..</p>
<p>$aColors = array_map(‘utf8_encode’,$aColors); //If you’re using special characters<br>
$iProductEntityTypeId = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;getResource()-&gt;getTypeId();<br>
$aOption = array();<br>
$aOption[‘attribute_id’] = $installer-&gt;getAttributeId($iProductEntityTypeId, $attrCode);</p>
<p>for($iCount=0;$iCount<!-- raw HTML omitted -->addAttributeOption($aOption);<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>$installer-&gt;endSetup();{/code}<br>
Now you just need to give the <strong>existing</strong> product attribute name AND <strong>future</strong> attribute options to this script. Run it and rest all script will do for you! 🙂</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a good practice to create your database backup every day/week. But to manually go to Magento admin and create backup daily is a cumbersome process. You can’t guarantee that your database will be secure especially if you are on a cloud storage. Backups are MUST and if it’s automated, life becomes very easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This code will create backup of your Magento DB and place it to var/backups directory.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}public function backup()&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{&lt;br&gt;&#xA;try {&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a good practice to create your database backup every day/week. But to manually go to Magento admin and create backup daily is a cumbersome process. You can’t guarantee that your database will be secure especially if you are on a cloud storage. Backups are MUST and if it’s automated, life becomes very easier.</p>
<p>This code will create backup of your Magento DB and place it to var/backups directory.<br>
{code type=php}public function backup()<br>
{<br>
try {</p>
<p>$backupDb = Mage::getModel(‘backup/db’);<br>
$backup = Mage::getModel(‘backup/backup’)<br>
-&gt;setTime(time())<br>
-&gt;setType(‘db’)<br>
-&gt;setPath(Mage::getBaseDir(“var”) . DS . “backups”);</p>
<p>$backupDb-&gt;createBackup($backup);</p>
<p>return Mage::helper(‘core’)-&gt;__(‘Backup successfully created’);</p>
<p>} catch (Exception $e) {<br>
Mage::logException($e);<br>
}</p>
<p>return $this;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now, you can set the cron to run every midnight and call this above method to automatically create your DB backups. Sounds good? But there is a problem. As Magento DB size is huge, running daily/weekly backups will soon fill up your hardrives like hell.</p>
<p>So, we will now first create new DB database backup through our above method, and after it’s created we will delete the older backups just to free up the disk space.</p>
<p>{code type=php}public function endsWith($haystack, $needle)<br>
{<br>
$length = strlen($needle);<br>
if ($length == 0) {<br>
return true;<br>
}</p>
<p>return (substr($haystack, -$length) === $needle);<br>
}</p>
<p>public function backup()<br>
{</p>
<p>//get all the older db backup files in an array<br>
$filelist = array();<br>
if ($handle = opendir(Mage::getBaseDir(‘var’) . DS . “backups” . DS)) {<br>
while ($entry = readdir($handle)) {<br>
if ($this-&gt;endsWith($entry, “_db.gz”)) {<br>
$filelist[] = $entry;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
closedir($handle);<br>
}</p>
<p>try {<br>
//create the db backup<br>
$backupDb = Mage::getModel(‘backup/db’);<br>
$backup = Mage::getModel(‘backup/backup’)<br>
-&gt;setTime(time())<br>
-&gt;setType(‘db’)<br>
-&gt;setPath(Mage::getBaseDir(“var”) . DS . “backups”);</p>
<p>$backupDb-&gt;createBackup($backup);</p>
<p>//delete all older db backup files we found<br>
foreach((array)$filelist as $fileToDelete) {<br>
unlink(Mage::getBaseDir(“var”) . DS . “backups” . DS . $fileToDelete);<br>
}</p>
<p>return Mage::helper(‘core’)-&gt;__(‘Backup successfully created’);</p>
<p>} catch (Exception $e) {<br>
Mage::logException($e);<br>
}</p>
<p>return $this;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now you can set the CRON to run the file every midnight, which calls the above backup() method. You will now get daily fresh backups replacing the old ones 🙂</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was working with a German client, who wanted to show additional product attribute options in the order and invoice emails due to stricter law for e-commerce in their country. Magento provides basic information in the default email templates, but each store has their unique requirement to show additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will show you how to add extra product attribute values, along with order item options and custom options in order emails and invoice emails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was working with a German client, who wanted to show additional product attribute options in the order and invoice emails due to stricter law for e-commerce in their country. Magento provides basic information in the default email templates, but each store has their unique requirement to show additional information.</p>
<p>I will show you how to add extra product attribute values, along with order item options and custom options in order emails and invoice emails.</p>
<p>Here is the code that should work for order and invoice emails to get additional PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES displayed:<br>
{code type=php}$productId = $_item-&gt;getProduct()-&gt;getId(); //for order emails<br>
//$productId = $_item-&gt;getProductId(); //for invoice emails<br>
$product = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($productId);<br>
$attributes = $product-&gt;getAttributes();</p>
<p>//Get a list of all PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES you want to show in this array…<br>
$dispAttribs = array(‘hardrive’, ‘memory’, ‘processor’);</p>
<p>foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {<br>
$attributeCode = $attribute-&gt;getAttributeCode();<br>
if(!in_array($attributeCode, $dispAttribs)) continue;<br>
$label = $attribute-&gt;getFrontend()-&gt;getLabel($product);<br>
$value = $attribute-&gt;getFrontend()-&gt;getValue($product);<br>
echo “<br>
<strong>” . $label . “:</strong> ” . $value;<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>For displaying CUSTOM OPTIONS and/or ITEM OPTIONS from the item, use this:<br>
{code type=php}foreach($this-&gt;getItemOptions() as $opt) {<br>
if(isset($opt[‘option_id’])) { //for CUSTOM OPTIONS<br>
echo “<strong>” . $opt[‘label’] . “:</strong> “. $opt[‘option_value’] . “<br>
“;<br>
} else { //for ITEM OPTIONS<br>
echo “<strong>” . $opt[‘label’] . “:</strong> “. $opt[‘value’] . “<br>
“;<br>
}<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>For adding code to ORDER emails, the file where the code should go is:<br>
app/design/frontend/base/default/template/email/order/items/order/default.phtml</p>
<p>For adding code to INVOICE emails, the file where the code should go is:<br>
app/design/frontend/base/default/template/email/order/items/invoice/default.phtml</p>
<p>Instead of base/default, you can put it in your custom theme location which is obvious.</p>

For those who want to create (if no root user in mysql) or reset the password for the Root user in Mysql (in Linux), this post is definately going to help you. I had a tough time in getting this to work, so thought to share it with anyone facing the same problem.</p>
<p>You need to use <strong>–skip-grant-tables</strong> if you don’t know mysql password to login. You can use it like this:</p>
<p><em>/usr/bin/mysqld_safe –skip-grant-tables &amp;</em></p>
<p>Once you run the above command on terminal, write <em>mysql</em> and hit enter. That’s because you already said Mysql that you want to skip all the privileges checking and allowing you with all the database access without password.</p>
<p>You should be inside mysql now. Now execute the command <em>use mysql;</em> because we are going to create/change the user in “mysql” database.</p>
<p>Now, check if you have the root user in the “user” table. Do this by:<br>
<em>select * from user;</em></p>
<p>If you already have root user, just execute this to change the password:<br>
<em>UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD(‘new-password’) WHERE User=’root’;</em></p>
<p>If you don’t have any records in user table, create one:<br>
<em>insert into <code>user</code> (<code>Host</code>, <code>User</code>, <code>Password</code>, <code>Select\_priv</code>, <code>Insert\_priv</code>, <code>Update\_priv</code>, <code>Delete\_priv</code>, <code>Create\_priv</code>, <code>Drop\_priv</code>, <code>Reload\_priv</code>, <code>Shutdown\_priv</code>, <code>Process\_priv</code>, <code>File\_priv</code>, <code>Grant\_priv</code>, <code>References\_priv</code>, <code>Index\_priv</code>, <code>Alter\_priv</code>, <code>Show\_db\_priv</code>, <code>Super\_priv</code>, <code>Create\_tmp\_table\_priv</code>, <code>Lock\_tables\_priv</code>, <code>Execute\_priv</code>, <code>Repl\_slave\_priv</code>, <code>Repl\_client\_priv</code>, <code>Create\_view\_priv</code>, <code>Show\_view\_priv</code>, <code>Create\_routine\_priv</code>, <code>Alter\_routine\_priv</code>, <code>Create\_user\_priv</code>, <code>ssl\_type</code>, <code>ssl\_cipher</code>, <code>x509\_issuer</code>, <code>x509\_subject</code>, <code>max\_questions</code>, <code>max\_updates</code>, <code>max\_connections</code>, <code>max\_user\_connections</code>)<br>
values(‘localhost’,’root’,”,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’, ‘Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,’Y’,”,”,”,”,’0′,’0′,’0′,’0′);</em></p>
<p>This creates new user “root” with no password.<br>
To set a password, use the above UPDATE command.</p>
<p>After it’s done, don’t forget to execute <em>flush privileges;</em></p>
<p>Restart mysql and you should be now able to login with root user and your new password.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, here is the stuff I collected and created from myriad number of websites/blogs/forums/ magento source codebase during my Magento certification preparation. I have put all the things I found and studied during my preparation in one place, so that other developers who are preparing for the exam can benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Credits to all who have contributed these things over the web from where I copied for study purpose. Few credits to me as well as I also have contributed many things in it 🙂 This may contain errors and wrong information and I don’t guarantee it to be completely correct. But this should be a good resource if you want a heads up! Please be aware that you need to go through the study guide and fundamental videos yourself in order to pass this exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys, here is the stuff I collected and created from myriad number of websites/blogs/forums/ magento source codebase during my Magento certification preparation. I have put all the things I found and studied during my preparation in one place, so that other developers who are preparing for the exam can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Credits to all who have contributed these things over the web from where I copied for study purpose. Few credits to me as well as I also have contributed many things in it 🙂 This may contain errors and wrong information and I don’t guarantee it to be completely correct. But this should be a good resource if you want a heads up! Please be aware that you need to go through the study guide and fundamental videos yourself in order to pass this exam.</p>
<p><em>If you are here to prepare for Interview, then I would recommend you to also go through these links:</em><br>

<p>The below stuff alone will definitely not going to help you much in passing the exam. Not to mention, these resource can also be used for Magento interview preparation.</p>

Magento supports and loads translations in the following order:</p>
<p>– Module Translation CSV in /app/locale<br>
– Theme Translation CSV in /app/design/</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/locale (theme folder translate)<br>
– DB Translation Database (table core_translate) ——-<br>
How many options exist to add a custom translation for any given string?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are three options in Magento to add a custom translation to a text string: module translation, theme translation and inline translation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Module translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Module translations are stored in app/locale/languagecode_COUNTRYCODE/ folder in form of csv files, named as Namespace_Modulename.csv All string in extensions that are inside __() method can be translated this way</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Theme translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Strings can be translated inside your theme, for that you just need to set locale via Magento admin area, then create translate.csv in app/design/frontend/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/locale/ languagecode_COUNTRYCODE and put your translated strings inside this CSV<br>
“My Cart”,”My Basket”<br>
“My Account”,”Account”<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Inline translation</li>
</ol>
<p>To enable inline translation you need to log into Admin panel and go to System -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Developer.<br>
You need to select Store view from scope select and enable inline translation for this desired store view there.</p>

<p>Magento uses the Front Controller pattern for the following purposes:</p>
<p>Receiving and processing browser data, transferring it to other system elements;<br>
Defining controller and proper action to perform using routes;<br>
Displaying browser-requested data using blocks, templates and model data.</p>

The layout initialization happens as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instances of the Layout and Layout Update are created.</li>
<li>Layout handles are added according to the $handles argument if passed.</li>
<li>Store layout handle STORE_[store_code] is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if code of current store is en, then layout handle STORE_en is added.</li>
<li>Theme layout handle THEME_[area]_[package]_[layout_theme] is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if the page rendered is for the frontend area, the current theme package name is magebase and theme name for layout is modern, then the layout handle THEME_frontend_magebase_modern is added.</li>
<li>Action layout handle is added to the Layout Update Instance. For example, if the page rendered is a category detail page, then Magento is executing catalog module’s category controller’s view action. So it will add an action handle catalog_category_view.</li>
<li>All Layout XML files defined for all active modules are loaded</li>
<li>If a layout file named local.xml exists in the current theme’s layout folder, it is loaded last</li>
<li>Layout updates of all added layout handles from the loaded layout XML are merged</li>
<li>Layout updates of all added layout handles from the database are merged</li>
<li>If the $generateXML argument of loadLayout() method is passed as false, the initialization is finished.</li>
<li>The layout update data is refined by removing all blocks and block references defined with the remove tag. (As discussed in Part 1)</li>
<li>If $generateBlocks argument is passed as false, the initialization is finished.</li>
<li>The instances of block classes are created according to the block definitions in the Layout XML</li>
<li>The methods are called with specified arguments on the blocks where action tags are defined. (As discussed in Part 1)<br>
——-</li>
</ol>
<p>A layout should have at least one *output* block. Normally, the root block is the only output block in a layout but there can be multiple output blocks for a single page. In that case, the output of each output block is merged and returned in the response.</p>
<p>The *non-output* blocks are child blocks of output blocks and are normally rendered with the getChildHtml() method. There are also two other methods: getChildChildHtml() and getBlockHtml() also used to render non-output blocks.<br>
——-</p>
<p>Blocks can be instantiated via layout xml (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->dipatch() that does the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Process scheduled cron queue: Magento reads the cron schedule table for jobs that need to be executed this very second and jobs that should have already been executed, i.e. with timestamps in the past, that haven’t expired. The expiry limit is also a parameter, configurable in the admin panel. After all the work, dispatch method calls two generate() and cleanup() methods</p>
<p>Generate tasks schedule: Mage_Cron_Model_Observer-&gt;generate(), this method searches final configuration file for content of <!-- raw HTML omitted --> nodes ($config = Mage::getConfig()-&gt;getNode(‘crontab/jobs’); ), reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;cron_expr&gt; elements to find out when and how often they need to be executed and pulls this data into the cron_schedule table.&lt;/cron_expr&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Cleanup: Mage_Cron_Model_Observer-&gt;cleanup(), this method deletes completed (with ‘success’ status) or missed ($time &lt; $now – $scheduleLifetime, where $scheduleLifetime are set in Magento admin area) jobs from cron_schedule DB table. &mdash;&mdash;- 1. All .xml files are collected into one big simpleXmlElement object 2. First, data is loaded from app/etc/*.xml and then from app/etc/modules/*.xml. Based on the module loaded information, config.xml is loaded from the etc directory of the module. If we load backend to check ACL and build menu elements, adminhtml.xml and system.xml are loaded as well. Configuration data from the database is the last one to load. 3. Any parameters, except the ones stored in app/etc/local.xml, can be overridden in config.xml of a custom module. P.S. Even though Magento provides us with such convenient methods as Mage:: getStoreConfig() and Mage:: getStoreConfigFlag(), we can reach any element of the configuration tree with the help of Mage::getConfig()-&gt;getNode($path, $scope, $scopeCode);</p>

Difference: A Website, a Store and a Store View.</p>
<p>Each websites has its unique customer and order base, base currency and prices.<br>
Stores can be used to define for example different (looking) stores with the same information.<br>
Store Views are mostly used to handle different languages on your website. You will typically have one Store View per language.</p>

Setting And Getting Cookies</p>
<p>To set cookies:</p>
<p>Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;set(‘cookie_name’, ‘cookie_value’, 0); # session cookie<br>
Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;set(‘cookie_name’, ‘cookie_value’, 60); #lasts 60 seconds</p>
<p>To get cookies:</p>
<p>Mage::getModel(‘core/cookie’)-&gt;get(‘made_productalerts_stock’);</p>

<p>Sending Transactional E-Mails</p>
<p>$email = Mage::getModel(‘core/email_template’);</p>
<p>$email-&gt;sendTransactional(<br>
‘some_email_template’, // template<br>
array(‘name’ =&gt; ‘Your Company’, ’email’ =&gt; ‘contact@yourcompany.com’), // sender details<br>
‘joe@joebloggs.com’, // recipient email<br>
‘Joe Bloggs’, // recipient name<br>
array(‘customerName’ =&gt; ‘Joe Bloggs’), // merge vars<br>
Mage::app()-&gt;getStore()-&gt;getStoreId() // store id<br>
);</p>

$helper-&gt;init($product, ‘image’);<br>
$helper-&gt;resize(216, 161);</p>

Adding A Layout Handle From A Controller</p>
<p>If you really need to add a handle to a controller, you need to replace the call to $this-&gt;loadLayout() with:</p>
<p>$update = $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;getUpdate();<br>
$update-&gt;addHandle(‘default’);<br>
$this-&gt;addActionLayoutHandles();<br>
$update-&gt;addHandle(‘your_handle’);<br>
$this-&gt;loadLayoutUpdates();<br>
$this-&gt;generateLayoutXml();<br>
$this-&gt;generateLayoutBlocks();<br>
$this-&gt;_isLayoutLoaded = true;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I gave my Magento Certified Developer exam and passed with a decent score. After sharing my score and success in the exam, most of my friends asked me how to prepare for this exam. So, here I share with you guys what I studied/prepared for this exam.</p>
<p>For passing or getting good score in this exam, you must have very decent experience in Magento. Good amount of projects with both frontend and backend hands-on is highly recommended before taking this test.</p>
<p>I prepared for 2 months, along with my work. Thanks to my wife who allowed me to study for the exam without disturbing or complaining 🙂 In the last 15 days before my test, I thank my Boss who allowed me to also prepare for the exam in the work hours.</p>
<p>First of all, I went through the videos available Free (On-Demand, 40 Hours, Fundamentals of Magento) on Magento website. You can even purchase more videos if you are interested.<br>
<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/training/on-demand">http://www.magentocommerce.com/training/on-demand</a></p>
<p>Then, most of the time I spent on Study Guide PDF. It’s very important because for each question it asks you, you have to dig the Magento source code to find the answer. That also helps you in improving your understanding of Magento architecture.<br>
<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/">http://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/</a> (under Resources Tab)</p>
<p>Once you think that you are now prepared with all the items listed in the Study Guide PDF, you can cross-check it with the Magento Self-Assessment Checklist PDF.<br>
<a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/services/certification">https://www.magentocommerce.com/services/certification</a></p>
<p>Go through all the articles by Alan Storm in the Knowledge Base section of Magentocommerce website. (Actually, that is the first step I took when starting my Magento career)<br>
Magestore.com has an dedicated blog category for Certification, go through all the topics:<br>
<a href="http://blog.magestore.com/category/magento-tutorials/magento-certificate-material/">http://blog.magestore.com/category/magento-tutorials/magento-certificate-material/</a></p>
<p>(If you still have time, I would recommend you to go through the stack overflow answers, related to Magento, given by Alan Storm, Vinai Kopp, …)<br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/485589/vinai">http://stackoverflow.com/users/485589/vinai</a><br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4668/alan-storm">http://stackoverflow.com/users/4668/alan-storm</a><br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/465971/ivan-chepurnyi">http://stackoverflow.com/users/465971/ivan-chepurnyi</a><br>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/magento/topusers">Stack Overflow top Magento answerers</a><br>
You can find many more Magento gurus on StackOverflow.</p>
<p>Considering you have completed all the above mentioned preparation guides, there is no way you can fail in Magento Certified Developer exam!</p>
<p>Best luck.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to check whether your desired domain name is available or not in different extensions, it’s tiresome to search it for each and every tld. There are also limits of performing query to whois on websites, where they will not allow you unlimited whois information queries. It’s better to have your own script which will tell you the availibility of domain name in different extensions, right from your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to check whether your desired domain name is available or not in different extensions, it’s tiresome to search it for each and every tld. There are also limits of performing query to whois on websites, where they will not allow you unlimited whois information queries. It’s better to have your own script which will tell you the availibility of domain name in different extensions, right from your terminal.</p>
<p>Below script will check your domain name for TLDs .com, .net, .org, .info, .us, .co, .tel, .tv, .biz, .cc, .ru, .eu, .in, .it, .sk, .com.au, .sh, .re and .dk<br>
But you can add other TLDs also if you want.</p>
<p>First create a file, e.g. chkWhois.sh, and give it proper permission to execute.<br>
{code type=php}touch chkWhois.sh<br>
chmod 744 chkWhois.sh{/code}</p>
<p>Now, copy below code to this newly created file</p>
<p>{code type=perl}#!/bin/bash</p>
<p>if [ “$#” == “0” ]; then<br>
echo “You need to supply at least one domain name!”<br>
exit 1<br>
fi</p>
<p>DOMAINS=( ‘.com’ ‘.net’ ‘.info’ ‘.us’ ‘.co’ \<br>
‘.org’ ‘.tel’ ‘.biz’ ‘.tv’ ‘.cc’ ‘.eu’ ‘.ru’ \<br>
‘.in’ ‘.it’ ‘.sk’ ‘.com.au’ ‘.sh’ ‘.re’ ‘.dk’ )</p>
<p>ELEMENTS=${#DOMAINS[@]}</p>
<p>while (( “$#” )); do</p>
<p>for (( i=0;i&lt;$ELEMENTS;i++)); do whois $1${DOMAINS[${i}]} | egrep -q &lsquo;^No match|^NOT FOUND|^Not fo|AVAILABLE|^No Data Fou|has not been regi|No entri&rsquo; if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo &ldquo;$1${DOMAINS[${i}]} : available&rdquo; fi done shift done{/code} Run this for your desired name to check, {code type=php}./chkWhois.sh kalpesh{/code} You&rsquo;ll get output will all the TLD&rsquo;s your name is available for! {code type=php}kalpesh.us : available kalpesh.tel : available kalpesh.cc : available kalpesh.eu : available kalpesh.ru : available kalpesh.sk : available kalpesh.sh : available kalpesh.re : available kalpesh.dk : available{/code} Have fun!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In linux, to check the whois of any domain name, the simple command is:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}whois domainname.com{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But, it will show you so many things which are not important, e.g. it will show you the NOTICE and TERMS of USE and so many other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are only concerned of getting the email address and creation/updation/expiry date of domain name from whois, here is the bash script that will help you out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;First create a bash script file, e.g. whoisEmailAndDates.sh and give it permissions to run:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}touch whoisEmailAndDates.sh&lt;br&gt;&#xA;chmod 744 whoisEmailAndDates.sh{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In linux, to check the whois of any domain name, the simple command is:<br>
{code type=php}whois domainname.com{/code}<br>
But, it will show you so many things which are not important, e.g. it will show you the NOTICE and TERMS of USE and so many other things.</p>
<p>If you are only concerned of getting the email address and creation/updation/expiry date of domain name from whois, here is the bash script that will help you out.<br>
First create a bash script file, e.g. whoisEmailAndDates.sh and give it permissions to run:<br>
{code type=php}touch whoisEmailAndDates.sh<br>
chmod 744 whoisEmailAndDates.sh{/code}</p>
<p>Now, copy below code and paste it in the newly created file:<br>
{code type=perl}#!/bin/sh</p>
<p>echo “”<br>
echo “######## WHOIS: “$1</p>
<p># Whois using the input variable<br>
whois $1 |\</p>
<p># Remove EOL characters<br>
tr -d ‘\015\032’ |\</p>
<p># Remove leading spaces<br>
sed ‘s/^ *//’ |\</p>
<p># Remove common unnecessary words from output<br>
grep -v -e “http://” -e “WHOIS” &gt; wtmp1.txt</p>
<p># Display all of the date lines and email addresses<br>
grep -Eio ‘([[:alnum:]_.]+@[[:alnum:]_]+ ?\.[[:alpha:].]{2,6})’ wtmp1.txt<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how to attach products to order programatically? It may require if you want to surprise your customer by giving them some special items along with their ordered products. Magento doesn’t allow you to do this, you need to write it through calling observer for event sales_order_place_after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Copy this in the observer file which observes order place after event.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$product = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&amp;gt;loadByAttribute(‘sku’, $skuToAdd); //your product SKU to add&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$qty = 1;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$rowTotal = $product-&amp;gt;getPrice();&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$orderItem = Mage::getModel(‘sales/order_item’)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setStoreId($order-&amp;gt;getStore()-&amp;gt;getStoreId())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setQuoteItemId(NULL)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setQuoteParentItemId(NULL)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setProductId($product-&amp;gt;getId())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setProductType($product-&amp;gt;getTypeId())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setQtyBackordered(NULL)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setTotalQtyOrdered($qty)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setQtyOrdered($qty)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setName($product-&amp;gt;getName())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setSku($product-&amp;gt;getSku())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setPrice($product-&amp;gt;getPrice())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setBasePrice($product-&amp;gt;getPrice())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setOriginalPrice($product-&amp;gt;getPrice())&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setRowTotal($rowTotal)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setBaseRowTotal($rowTotal)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt;setOrder($order);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$orderItem-&amp;gt;save();{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Please note that you may also need to add the entry in sales_flat_quote_item table to be 100% sure it’s going to work for reorder also. If you’re not worried about reordering, the above code is fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After struggling for finding the way to show aggregate ratings and total number of reviews for the wordpress plugin WP Customer Reviews, I wrote it myself by studying their code. There has been several requests for this feature in their support page and around but they didn’t seem to be interested or didn’t got enough time to wrote this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so for all the people who have been struggling to get total and/or aggregate number of ratings and reviews, here is the code that can work on any page/post.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}global $wpdb;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$pId = $post-&amp;gt;ID; //if using in another page, use the ID of the post/page you want to show ratings for.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$row = $wpdb-&amp;gt;get_results(“SELECT COUNT(*) AS &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt;,AVG(review_rating) AS &lt;code&gt;aggregate\_rating&lt;/code&gt;,MAX(review_rating) AS &lt;code&gt;max\_rating&lt;/code&gt; FROM wp_wpcreviews WHERE &lt;code&gt;page\_id&lt;/code&gt;= $pId AND &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;=1”);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$max_rating = $row[0]-&amp;gt;max_rating;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$aggregate_rating = $row[0]-&amp;gt;aggregate_rating;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$total_reviews = $row[0]-&amp;gt;total;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$totl = $aggregate_rating * 20;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$wpdb-&amp;gt;flush();{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both of the functions looks similar, but there is a difference, which can screw your time if you’re not aware of it and using blindly! is_int() seems same to is_numeric(), checking the variable if it’s integer or not, but it’s not exactly what you’re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key difference between these two functions is that is_int() checks the &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; of variable, while is_numeric() checks the &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; of the variable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From PHP.net,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;is_int:&lt;/em&gt; Find whether the type of a variable is integer&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;is_numeric:&lt;/em&gt; Finds whether a variable is a number or a numeric string&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The key difference between these two functions is that is_int() checks the <strong>type</strong> of variable, while is_numeric() checks the <strong>value</strong> of the variable.</p>
<p>From PHP.net,<br>
<em>is_int:</em> Find whether the type of a variable is integer<br>
<em>is_numeric:</em> Finds whether a variable is a number or a numeric string</p>
<p>So, if you check something like:<br>
{code type=php}$var = “123”;{/code}<br>
$var is a string of numbers, not an integer value.<br>
Therefor <em>is_int should return false</em> as it’s not an integer, it’s a string.<br>
However it is a numeric string, so hence <em>is_numeric should return true</em>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a select dropdown for any product attribute, to get the value from label or vice versa is always needed in order to display or get value for further processing, etc. Every now and then you will require this values while working on product attributes. There aer many ways you can achieve it but the best, in terms of performance and simplicity is what I will tell you here. Get product attribute’s value from label, label from value easily in Magento.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a select dropdown for any product attribute, to get the value from label or vice versa is always needed in order to display or get value for further processing, etc. Every now and then you will require this values while working on product attributes. There aer many ways you can achieve it but the best, in terms of performance and simplicity is what I will tell you here. Get product attribute’s value from label, label from value easily in Magento.</p>
<p>Suppose, you have an product attribute called “color” in Magento. You have the label (e.g. Red), and you want to find it’s value. The below code will help you get the value for it.<br>
{code type=php}$productModel = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’);<br>
$attr = $productModel-&gt;getResource()-&gt;getAttribute(“color”);<br>
if ($attr-&gt;usesSource()) {<br>
echo $color_id = $attr-&gt;getSource()-&gt;getOptionId(“Red”);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now suppose, you have the value (let’s say 8, for Red) for your attribute, but want to get the label for it. Below code will help you to achive it.</p>
<p>{code type=php}$productModel = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’);<br>
$attr = $productModel-&gt;getResource()-&gt;getAttribute(“color”);<br>
if ($attr-&gt;usesSource()) {<br>
echo $color_label = $attr-&gt;getSource()-&gt;getOptionText(“8”);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Note that the only thing changed in both is, getOptionId() and getOptionText. getOptionId() will accept label and give you value, while getOptionText() will accept value and give you label.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When trying to submit a form which is created in admin, it redirects to dashboard no matter how much you try. I faced this problem and tried many things but without any luck. Everything was running, for file upload I had enctype=”multipart/form-data” in form, checked the form action through firebug and run it directly in browser URL which was also going good. After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After so much frustration, googled the problem and found that I was not the only one to face this problem.</p>
<p>Finally, got one forum where I found the solution to this problem. In Magento, when submitting the form, you need to have one extra hidden field, with name “form_key” which should have form’s key value from session. Here is the line of code, which helped me in posting form successfully.</p>
<p>{code type=php}&lt;input name=&ldquo;form_key&rdquo; type=&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; value=&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” /&gt; {/code}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting route name, module name, controller name and action name is very easy in Magento. You can get these values anywhere, in controller itself and also in template files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=php}Mage::app()-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;getControllerName();&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mage::app()-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;getActionName();&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mage::app()-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;getRouteName();&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mage::app()-&amp;gt;getRequest()-&amp;gt;getModuleName();{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you are using some script to automatically add products to categories from XLS file to your Magento system, you may need to delete all products frequently for testing purpose. It’s not as easy to mark all products and press delete button in admin. No, it’s not like that, you need to delete all products, remove them from their linked categories, reset the inventory, etc. so many things to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to merge two arrays with array_merge, but have you came across to merge two objects? It’s not that easy in Magento. You need to convert it to array first, merge them, and convert it to the object again to make it work. If you have two objects of different class, then it’s really difficult job to merge as both will not be compatible. If they are from similar classes or share same elements inside, then it’s not that tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If they are from similar classes or share same elements inside, then it’s not that tricky.</p>
<p>If you want to add collection2 in collection1 (in Magento), where collection1 will be a merged form of both, you can do so by:<br>
{code type=php}foreach($collection2 as $coll) {<br>
$collection1-&gt;addItem($coll);<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>In core PHP, it’s quite easy in this way:<br>
{code type=php}$merged_obj = (object) array_merge( (array) $collection1, (array) $collection2 );{/code}</p>
<p>In Magento, converting collection to array is easy:<br>
{code type=php}$arr = $collection-&gt;toArray();{/code}<br>
while vice versa is difficult as Magento doesn’t have any built-in method to do so.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When trying to add new user programatically, you will need to first check whether the customer is already registered or not in the system. For that, email address is required, as Magento uses email address for login purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below is the code which checks if customer is already there in the database, with some particular website id if any.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}protected function _customerExists($email, $websiteId = null)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$customer = Mage::getModel(‘customer/customer’);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;if ($websiteId) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$customer-&amp;gt;setWebsiteId($websiteId);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$customer-&amp;gt;loadByEmail($email);&lt;br&gt;&#xA;if ($customer-&amp;gt;getId()) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;return $customer;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;return false;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mysql delete duplicate records leaving one row. Consider that there are many duplicate records in the table and you want to remove it. Now, we can select it by applying GROUP BY but the question is how to delete all the duplicate records (of field some_id below) EXCEPT one that should be there. So, lets say I have following table with duplicate data as shown:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Tablename: test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;unique_id | some_id&lt;br&gt;&#xA;——————–&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1 | 1&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2 | 1&lt;br&gt;&#xA;3 | 2&lt;br&gt;&#xA;4 | 2&lt;br&gt;&#xA;5 | 1&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s always a good idea to get as much information as you get from customer.

‘required’ =&gt; false,<br>

));<br>
$installer-&gt;endSetup();<br>
$installer-&gt;installEntities();{/code}</p>
<p>Once attributes are added to database, you can easily add HTML in the customer’s profile page where you want them to display.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever came with the requirement where you need to set cron for periodically running certain jobs automatically? If you are new to cron in Magento, this blog post is going to help you out. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are basically two crons: one is &lt;strong&gt;system’s cron&lt;/strong&gt; (Unix, where it will trigger the specified file, for each specified time (in terms of minute, hour, day, week, year) AND another is &lt;strong&gt;Magento’s internal cron&lt;/strong&gt; where it will decide which file and method to call to complete the operation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you are new to cron in Magento, this blog post is going to help you out. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.</p>
<p>There are basically two crons: one is <strong>system’s cron</strong> (Unix, where it will trigger the specified file, for each specified time (in terms of minute, hour, day, week, year) AND another is <strong>Magento’s internal cron</strong> where it will decide which file and method to call to complete the operation.</p>
<p>– First, you need to add following snipped in your module’s config.xml file, inside <!-- raw HTML omitted --> node:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;cron_name_must_be_unique&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&lt;cron_expr&gt;0 0 * * *&lt;/cron_expr&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->modulename/modelname::methodname<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;/cron_name_must_be_unique&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{/code}</p>
<p>– Now open crontab of your system, by typing this in terminal:<br>
<code>crontab -l</code><br>
This will list the cron defined in system, check if there is already cron set up for Magento, you don’t need to do anything here.<br>
Else, type this in terminal:<br>
<code>crontab -e</code><br>
and add the below line at the end of file:<br>
<code>*/5 * * * * /bin/sh /var/www/magento/cron.sh</code><br>
(this will run system’s cron every 5 minutes, you can change it as per your need)</p>

<p>To configure your Magento with a new domain, you will need to do following steps:</p>
<p>– Copy whole Magento project from current server and paste it to the new server.<br>
You can do server-to-server transfer. First, tar.gz your magento project<br>
<code>tar -cvf magento.tar.gz magento</code><br>
Then copy it to your new server from old server<br>
<code>scp magento.tar.gz root@your.ip.address.here:/var/www/.</code></p>
<p>– Backup the database (Admin -&gt; System -&gt; Tools -&gt; Backup)<br>
You can also take backup through phpMyAdmin, or by mysql.<br>
<code>mysqldump -u user -p database &gt; /path/to/keep/db.sql</code></p>
<p>– Logout from your old server. Login to new server.<br>
Extract the file magento.tar.gz that you sent from old server<br>
<code>tar -zxvf magento.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>– Delete all directory or files that are there in cache folder<br>
<code>rm -rf var/cache/*</code></p>
<p>– Edit local.xml that is in magento/app/etc/local.xml and change mysql username, password, database as per new server credentials</p>
<p>– Import the backed up database. Before that create empty database to dump tables in it.<br>
<code>mysql -u root -p 'password';&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;create database dbname;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;exit;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;mysql -u root -p -d dbname &lt; /path/to/your/db.sql</code></p>
<p>- Edit the database to change it to your new domain name. Search in core_config_data table for old domain.<br>
<code>select * from core_config_data where path like '%secure/base_url';</code><br>
and update it with your new domain<br>
<code>update core_config_data set value='http://mysite.com/' where path like '%secure/base_url';</code></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento Interview questions and answers for freshers as well as experienced developers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Explain Magento’s MVC architecture</strong></p>
<p><em>First of all, what is MVC?</em></p>
<p>MVC stands for <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong>. Any application that separates it’s data access, business logic and user interface is called MVC. There can be two types of MVC: <strong>convention-based and configuration-based</strong>. Example, cakePHP is convention-based, i.e. you just need to follow the instructions of the core system to get your module ready in just few lines. Magento is configuration-based, i.e. you need to specify each and every thing to your module’s config file in order to get it work. Magento has controllers (for request/response routing), Block (for rendering content), Model (for business logic), Resource/Mysql4 (for database operations), etc (for module-specific configuration files), Helper (for common functions), sql (for setup scripts), layout (for connecting block with templates for each controller action) and template/.PHTML file (for Presentation i.e. View).</p>
<p><em>How Magento’s MVC works:</em></p>
<p>1. When you enter the URL (something like <a href="http://loca.lho.st/frontname/controller/method/param1/value1/param2/value2)">http://loca.lho.st/frontname/controller/method/param1/value1/param2/value2)</a>, this URL is intercepted by one PHP file called index.php which instantiates Magento application<br>
2. Magento application instantiates Front Controller object<br>
3. Further, front controller instantiates Router objects (specified in module’s config.xml, global tag)<br>
4. Now, Router is responsible to “match” the frontname which is in our URL<br>
5. If “match” is found, it sees controller name and method name in the URL, which is finally called.<br>
6. Now depending on what is written in action name (method name), it is executed. If any models are called in it, the controller method will instantiate that model and call the method in it which is requested.<br>
7. Then the controller action (method) instantiate the Layout object, which calls Block specified for this action (method) name (Each controller action name have block and template file associated with it, which can be found at app/design/frontend or adminhtml/namespace/module/layout/module.xml file, name of layout file (module.xml) can be found in config.xml of that module, in layout updates tag).<br>
8. Template file (.phtml) now calls the corresponding block for any method request. So, if you write $this-&gt;methodName in .phtml file, it will check “methodName” in the block file which is associated in module.xml file.<br>
9. Block contains PHP logic. It references Models for any data from DB.<br>
10. If either Block, Template file or Controller need to get/set some data from/to database, they can call Model directly like Mage::getModel(‘modulename/modelname’).<br>

<p><strong>2. How Magento ORM works?</strong></p>
<p>ORM stands for <strong>Object Relational Mapping</strong>. It’s a programming technique used to convert different types of data to Objects and vice versa.</p>
<p>In Magento, ORM is shown as Model (based on Zend Framework’s Zend_Db_Adapter), which further breaks down to two types of Models.</p>
<p>– First is the “simple” i.e. <strong>Regular</strong> Models which is nothing but flat table or our regular table structure.<br>
– Second Model is <strong>EAV</strong> (Entity Attribute Value), which is quite complicated and expensive to query.</p>
<p>All Magento Models interacting with database are inherited from Mage_Core_Model_Abstract class, which is further inherited from Varien_Object.</p>
<p>Difference between two Models is, Simple Model is inherited from <em>Mage_Core_Model_Resource_Db_Abstract</em> class,<br>
while EAV is inherited from <em>Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Abstract</em>.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know what EAV is, please read my 3rd answer below.</p>
<p>So, to end up this question,<br>
when you want to get some data in Magento, you call it like this:<br>
{code type=php}Mage::getModel(‘module/model’)-&gt;load(1);{/code}<br>
where 1 is the primary key id for some Regular/Simple table, while in EAV so many tables are joined to fetch just single row of data.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is EAV in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>EAV, stands for <strong>Entity Attribute Value</strong>, is a technique which allows you to add unlimited columns to your table virtually. Means, the fields which is represented in “column” way in a regular table, is represented in a “row” (records) way in EAV. In EAV, you have one table which holds all the “attribute” (table field names) data, and other tables which hold the “entity” (id or primary id) and value (value for that id) against each attribute.</p>
<p>In Magento, there is one table to hold attribute values called <em>eav_attribute</em> and 5-6 tables which holds entity and data in fully normalized form,</p>
<p>– eav_entity, eav_entity_int (for holding Integer values),<br>
– eav_entity_varchar (for holding Varchar values),<br>
– eav_entity_datetime (for holding Datetime values),<br>
– eav_entity_decimal (for holding Decimal/float values),<br>
– eav_entity_text (for holding text (mysql Text type) values).</p>
<p>EAV is expensive and should only be used when you are not sure about number of fields in a table which can vary in future. To just get one single record, Magento joins 4-5 tables to get data in EAV. But this doesn’t mean that EAV only has drawbacks. The main <strong>advantage of EAV</strong> is when you may want to add table field in future, when there are thousands or millions of records already present in your table. In regular table, if you add table field with these amount of data, it will screw up your table, as for each empty row also some bytes will be allocated as per data type you select. While in EAV, adding the table column will not affect the previously saved records (also the extra space will not get allocated!) and all the new records will seamlessly have data in these columns without any problem.</p>
<p><strong>4. Difference between Mage::getSingleton() and Mage::getModel()</strong></p>
<p>The difference between Mage:getSingleton() and Mage::getModel() is that the former one does not create an object if the object for same class is already created, while the later creates new objects every time for the class when it’s called.</p>
<p>Mage::getSingleton() uses the “<strong>singleton design pattern</strong>” of PHP. If the object is not created, it will create it.</p>
<p>Mage::getSingleton() is mostly used when you want to create an object once, modify it and later fetch from it. Popular example is session, you first create a session object, and then add/remove values from session across different pages, so that it retains your values (e.g. cart values, logged in customer details, etc.) and doesn’t create new session object losing your last changes.</p>
<p>Mage::getModel() is used when you want to have the fresh data from the database. Example is when you want to show records from database.</p>
<p><strong>8. How will you call a CMS page in your module’s PHTML file?</strong></p>
<p>$this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;createBlock(‘cms/block’)-&gt;setBlockId(‘blockidentifier’)-&gt;toHtml();</p>
<p><strong>9. What is codePool in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>codePool is a tag which you have to specify when registering new module in app/etc/modules/Company_Module.xml<br>
There are 3 codePools in Magento: core, community and local, which are resided at app/code/ directory.<br>
Core codePool is used by Magento core team, Community is generally used by 3rd party extensions and Local codePool should be used for in-hour module development and overriding of core and community modules for custom requirement.<br>
So in short, codePool helps Magento to locate module inside app/code/ for processing.</p>
<p><strong>15. When will you need to clear cache to see the changes in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>When you have added/modified XML, JS, CSS file(s).</p>
<p><strong>17. How will you enable product’s custom attribute visibility in frontend?</strong></p>
<p>In the <em>Manage Attributes</em> section of the custom attribute, select <em>Visible on Product View Page on Front-end</em> and <em>Used in Product Listing</em> to <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p><strong>19. Difference between EAV and flat model</strong></p>
<p>EAV is entity attribute value database model, where data is fully in normalized form. Each column data value is stored in their respective data type table. Example, for a product, product ID is stored in catalog_product_entity_int table, product name in catalog_product_entity_varchar, product price in catalog_product_entity_decimal, product created date in catalog_product_entity_datetime and product description in catalog_product_entity_text table. EAV is complex as it joins 5-6 tables even if you want to get just one product’s details. Columns are called attributes in EAV.</p>
<p>Flat model uses just one table, so it’s not normalized and uses more database space. It clears the EAV overhead, but not good for dynamic requirements where you may have to add more columns in database table in future. It’s good when comes to performance, as it will only require one query to load whole product instead of joining 5-6 tables to get just one product’s details. Columns are called fields in flat model.</p>
<p><strong>20. Is it mandatory to give Namespace while creating custom module in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>21. How will you override Block/Model/controllers in Magento?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2011/06/08/overriderewrite-magento-core-blocks-and-controllers/" title="Magento override block controller model helper">http://ka.lpe.sh/2011/06/08/overriderewrite-magento-core-blocks-and-controllers/</a></p>
<p><strong>23. How will you add/remove content from core’s system.xml file?</strong></p>
<p>You can do that by overriding system.xml configuration. Examples:<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overriding Catalog Frontend in system config<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->{/code}<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>24. Can you have more than one Grid in a module?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>25. How will you join flat table and EAV table in Magento?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2013/04/28/magento-join-eav-collection-with-flat-table/" title="Magento Join EAV collection with flat table">http://ka.lpe.sh/2013/04/28/magento-join-eav-collection-with-flat-table/</a></p>
<p><strong>26. How will you enable maintenance mode of your Magento website?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2011/12/31/magento-show-maintenance-mode-page-website-under-construction/" title="Magento show maintenance mode">http://ka.lpe.sh/2011/12/31/magento-show-maintenance-mode-page-website-under-construction/</a></p>
<p><strong>27. What are “magic methods” in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>Magento uses __call(), __get(), __set(), __uns(), __has(), __isset(), __toString(), __construct(), etc. magic methods. You can find more details inside class Varien_Object<br>
For more information about magic methods: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php" title="PHP magic methods">http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php</a></p>
<p><strong>28. How many database tables will Magento create when you make a new EAV module?</strong></p>
<p>Magento creates 6 tables when you create new EAV module. Tables: module, module_datetime, module_decimal, module_int, module_text and module_varchar. one is the main entity table, and rest 5 tables which holds attribute’s data in different data types. So that integer values will go to module_int table, price values to module_decimal, etc.</p>
<p><strong>33. Where will you write your module’s business logic in Magento?</strong></p>
<p>inside Model</p>
<p><strong>34. Explain different types of sessions in Magento (e.g. customer/session, checkout/session, core/session) and the reason why you store data in different session types?</strong></p>
<p>Customer sessions stores data related to customer, checkout session stores data related to quote and order. They are actuall under one session in an array. So firstname in customer/session will be $_SESSION[‘customer’][‘firstname’] and cart items count in checkout/session will be $_SESSION[‘checkout’][‘items_count’]. The reason Magento uses session types separately is because once the order gets placed, the checkout session data information should get flushed which can be easily done by just unsetting $_SESSION[‘checkout’] session variable. So that the session is not cleared, just session data containing checkout information is cleared and rest all the session types are still intact.</p>
<p><strong>35. What are the commonly used block types? What is the special in core/text_list block type.</strong></p>
<p>Commonly used block types: core/template, page/html, page/html_head, page/html_header, page/template_links, core/text_list, page/html_wrapper, page/html_breadcrumbs, page/html_footer, core/messages, page/switch.<br>
Some blocks like content, left, right etc. are of type core/text_list. When these blocks are rendered, all their child blocks are rendered automatically without the need to call getChildHtml() method.</p>
<p><strong>36. What are the different design patterns used in Magento?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/2013/02/25/magento-design-patterns/" title="Magento design patterns">http://ka.lpe.sh/2013/02/25/magento-design-patterns/</a></p>
<p><strong>37. What can you do to optimize Magento performance?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ka.lpe.sh/category/performance/" title="Magento Performance">http://ka.lpe.sh/category/performance/</a></p>
<p><strong>38. Where is the relation between configurable product and it’s simple product stored in database?</strong></p>
<p>In the 2 tables:<br>
catalog_product_relation<br>
catalog_product_superlink_table</p>
<p><strong>39. How will you log current collection’s SQL query?</strong></p>
<p>$collection-&gt;printLogQuery(true); OR $collection-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;__toString();</p>
<p><strong>40. How to get first item or last item from the collection?</strong></p>
<p>$collection-&gt;getFirstItem() and $collection-&gt;getLastItem();</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Add custom column in admin Grid which will show radio/checkbox button. I know this is weird, but some people need this as a requirement. Here I will show you how you can have radio button or checkbox button that you can have directly in your grids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For radio button,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$this-&amp;gt;addColumn(‘some_id’, array(&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘header_css_class’ =&amp;gt; ‘a-center’,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘header’ =&amp;gt; Mage::helper(‘adminhtml’)-&amp;gt;__(‘Some Header’),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘type’ =&amp;gt; ‘radio’,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘html_name’ =&amp;gt; ‘items[]’,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘align’ =&amp;gt; ‘center’,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;‘value’ =&amp;gt; array(‘1’)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;));{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>For radio button,<br>
{code type=php}$this-&gt;addColumn(‘some_id’, array(<br>
‘header_css_class’ =&gt; ‘a-center’,<br>
‘header’ =&gt; Mage::helper(‘adminhtml’)-&gt;__(‘Some Header’),<br>

‘html_name’ =&gt; ‘items[]’,<br>
‘align’ =&gt; ‘center’,<br>

));{/code}</p>
<p>For checkbox button,<br>
{code type=php}$this-&gt;addColumn(‘some_id’, array(<br>
‘header_css_class’ =&gt; ‘a-center’,<br>
‘header’ =&gt; Mage::helper(‘adminhtml’)-&gt;__(‘Some Header’),<br>
‘type’ =&gt; ‘radio’,<br>
‘field_name’ =&gt; ‘items[]’,<br>
‘align’ =&gt; ‘center’,<br>
‘values’ =&gt; array(‘1′,’2’)<br>
));{/code}</p>
<p>Further, in Form.php you can add this below code to have by default behavior and onclick behaviour:<br>
{code type=php}$fieldset-&gt;addField(‘some_id’, ‘checkbox’, array(<br>
‘checked’ =&gt; $this-&gt;getSomeId()==1 ? ‘true’ : ‘false’,<br>
‘onclick’ =&gt; ‘this.value = this.checked ? 1 : 0;’<br>
)); {/code}</p>
<p>Hope this helps some frustrated mind!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento, image quality is distorted when it’s resized in Category page as well as Product page. This is very bad if you are running an eCommerce website because image is the only thing which gives best impression to your customers. There are several complains regarding this in Magento forums with different answers. Some even suggest to use ImageMagick over the default Gd2 library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to switch to ImageMagick and also don’t want to do much changes, here is a simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is very bad if you are running an eCommerce website because image is the only thing which gives best impression to your customers. There are several complains regarding this in Magento forums with different answers. Some even suggest to use ImageMagick over the default Gd2 library.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to switch to ImageMagick and also don’t want to do much changes, here is a simple solution.</p>
<p>1.) Copy app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Helper/Image.php<br>
2.) Paste it in local (app/code/local/ , create directories Mage/Catalog/Helper if it’s not there)<br>
So the final structure will be app/code/local/Mage/Catalog/Helper/Image.php<br>
3.) Edit newly pasted Image.php’s init() method, just after it sets “watermark size”, add a line:<br>
{code type=php}$this-&gt;setQuality(100);{/code}<br>
4.) Save, flush image cache, run any category or product page and see the difference!</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

      <title>Magento: Difference between order states and statuses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2012-04-21-magento-order-state-vs-status/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are building website in Magento, you may have noticed that there are two columns in &lt;em&gt;sales_flat_order&lt;/em&gt; table which are confusing. These are &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;status&lt;/strong&gt;. You might think what is the difference between these two, both having same meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, this is not the case. They both are different. State is used by magento to tell if the order is new, processing, complete, holded, closed, canceled, etc.; while Statuses are the one that YOU would be defining at the backend in System -&amp;gt; Order Statuses. Magento displays order STATUSES and not STATES in the backend order detail page to let you know which status is assigned as per your mapping. Remember, multiple statuses can be mapped with one state, while vice versa is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are building website in Magento, you may have noticed that there are two columns in <em>sales_flat_order</em> table which are confusing. These are <strong>state</strong> and <strong>status</strong>. You might think what is the difference between these two, both having same meaning.</p>
<p>Well, this is not the case. They both are different. State is used by magento to tell if the order is new, processing, complete, holded, closed, canceled, etc.; while Statuses are the one that YOU would be defining at the backend in System -&gt; Order Statuses. Magento displays order STATUSES and not STATES in the backend order detail page to let you know which status is assigned as per your mapping. Remember, multiple statuses can be mapped with one state, while vice versa is not possible.</p>
<p>Consider an example, your customer places an order as Cash on Delivery, you will need something like COD_Pending as the order status so that you know it is not yet paid. Magento will have state <em>new</em> for this, which makes you unpredictable of what kind of transaction is this, COD or Prepaid. The STATUS can be anything, as you define, for your understanding; while STATE is something which Magento needs to understand, internally.</p>
<p>In short, Magento uses order state internally for processing order, whereas order status are used by store owners to understand the exact order flow where one state can be assigned to multiple statuses.</p>
<p>To understand this in detail, have a look at <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/2_-_magento_concepts_and_architecture/order_management">this</a><br>
Hope it helps!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magento has pre-defined methods for getters and setters which will convert camelcase string to underscore formatted string.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Example, Magento will convert &lt;em&gt;thisIsDummy&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;this_is_dummy&lt;/em&gt; using it’s method _underscore which is available at Varien_Object class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to convert &lt;strong&gt;Camel case string to Sentence case&lt;/strong&gt; (this may sound weird, but we got the requirement),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Example, from &lt;em&gt;thisIsDummy&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;This Is Dummy&lt;/em&gt;, below method will help you to do so:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=php}public function camelToSentence($word) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;if(isset($word)) {&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$result = ucwords(preg_replace(‘/(.)([A-Z])/’, “$1 $2”, $word));&lt;br&gt;&#xA;return $result;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;}{/code}&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with Magento Admin’s system configuration, you may have encountered with these models. If you don’t know, these models are used when you add custom fields through your system.xml file at Magento’s backend configuration (Admin -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Configuration).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the difference between these 3 models are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;source_model&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It specifies a Model class, where you will be returned with options that can populate in the current field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}&amp;lt;source_model&amp;gt;adminhtml/system_config_source_yesno&amp;lt;/source_model&amp;gt;{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;this will populate select dropdown with values Yes/No&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with Magento Admin’s system configuration, you may have encountered with these models. If you don’t know, these models are used when you add custom fields through your system.xml file at Magento’s backend configuration (Admin -&gt; System -&gt; Configuration).</p>
<p>Okay, so the difference between these 3 models are:</p>
<p><strong>source_model</strong>:<br>
It specifies a Model class, where you will be returned with options that can populate in the current field.</p>
<p>Example,<br>
{code type=php}&lt;source_model&gt;adminhtml/system_config_source_yesno&lt;/source_model&gt;{/code}<br>
this will populate select dropdown with values Yes/No</p>
<p><strong>frontend_model</strong>:<br>
It specifies a Block class to add custom render to use as a frontend field type instead of/along with default frontend_type field value (text, textarea, select, etc.).</p>
<p>Example,<br>
{code type=xml}&lt;frontend_type&gt;button&lt;/frontend_type&gt;<br>
&lt;frontend_model&gt;MyCustomModule/button&lt;/frontend_model&gt;{/code}<br>
this will keep frontend type as button, but the customized one taken from Block class Button.php of MyCustomModule module</p>
<p>Code at Button.php can be anything like this:<br>
{code type=php}&lt;?php class MyNamespace_MyCustomModule_Block_Button extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_System_Config_Form_Field
{</p>
<pre><code>protected function _getElementHtml(Varien_Data_Form_Element_Abstract $element)
{
    $this-?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>setElement($element);<br>
$url = $this-&gt;getUrl(‘catalog/product’);</p>
<p>$html = $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;createBlock(‘adminhtml/widget_button’)<br>
-&gt;setType(‘button’)<br>
-&gt;setClass(‘scalable’)<br>
-&gt;setLabel(‘Run Now !’)<br>
-&gt;setOnClick(“setLocation(‘$url’)”)<br>
-&gt;toHtml();</p>
<p>return $html;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
?&gt;{/code}</p>
<p><strong>backend_model</strong>:<br>
Generally, when you save any form at System Configuration, the data is stored in the table core_config_data. But if your requirement is to do something prior/after the save is performed, you can do it by having _beforeSave() &amp; _afterSave() methods defined in this custom/defined class.</p>
<p>Example,<br>
{code type=xml}&lt;backend_model&gt;adminhtml/system_config_backend_shipping_tablerate&lt;/backend_model&gt;{/code}</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In PHP, if you want to convert your xml data to array for looping and displaying purpose, it sometimes becomes tedious. If you already have a SimpleXML class and want to convert XML to Array without any notices, warnings and recursively preparing the array, here is the method that will do so without any modifications needed. This will work by pasting this in your class file, if you are not using object oriented approach, you will have to remove “public” and “$this-&amp;gt;” from this function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So here is how I converted XML to Array without any kind of hardcoding.</p>
<p><strong>PHP class method to convert xml to array</strong><br>
{code type=php}<br>
public function convertXmlObjToArr($obj, &amp;$arr){<br>
$children = $obj-&gt;children();<br>
$executed = false;<br>
foreach ($children as $elementName =&gt; $node){<br>
if($arr[$elementName]!=null){<br>
if($arr[$elementName][0]!==null){<br>
$i = count($arr[$elementName]);<br>
$this-&gt;convertXmlObjToArr($node, $arr[$elementName][$i]);<br>
}else{<br>
$tmp = $arr[$elementName];<br>
$arr[$elementName] = array();<br>
$arr[$elementName][0] = $tmp;<br>
$i = count($arr[$elementName]);<br>
$this-&gt;convertXmlObjToArr($node, $arr[$elementName][$i]);<br>
}<br>
}else{<br>
$arr[$elementName] = array();<br>
$this-&gt;convertXmlObjToArr($node, $arr[$elementName]);<br>
}<br>
$executed = true;<br>
}<br>
if(!$executed&amp;&amp;$children-&gt;getName()==””){<br>
$arr = (String)$obj;<br>
}<br>
return;<br>
}</p>

      <title>Magento: Linking multiple shipments with their invoices</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2012-01-17-magento-linking-multiple-shipments-with-their-invoices/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento, it’s a feature to create multiple invoices and shipments. But you can’t find the link between invoice with their respective shipment if you have more than one invoice and shipment. It’s because if you have forced invoice and shipment enabled (Invoice and Ship button combined in Manage Orders view page), it saves both invoice and shipment object together and hence can’t give the invoice id to shipment and hence fails in building the link between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Magento, it’s a feature to create multiple invoices and shipments. But you can’t find the link between invoice with their respective shipment if you have more than one invoice and shipment. It’s because if you have forced invoice and shipment enabled (Invoice and Ship button combined in Manage Orders view page), it saves both invoice and shipment object together and hence can’t give the invoice id to shipment and hence fails in building the link between them.</p>
<p>So what we need to do here is:<br>
1. Add a column to sales_flat_shipment which will store invoice increment id (say invoice_id)<br>
2. Before invoice and shipment are saved, get the invoice’s latest increment id and increment it by 1 (to get next invoice increment id)<br>
3. Give that invoice increment id to shipment object, so it will get saved along with other shipment columns</p>
<p>Here we go technically,</p>
<p>Firstly, add a column to sales_flat_shipment table.<br>
{code type=php}&lt;?php $installer = $this;</p>
<p>$installer-?&gt;
startSetup();</p>
<p>$installer-&gt;run(”<br>
ALTER TABLE sales_flat_shipment ADD COLUMN invoice_id VARCHAR(50) AFTER increment_id<br>
“);</p>
<p>$installer-&gt;endSetup();</p>
<p>?&gt;{/code}</p>
<p>Then, override InvoiceController.php of sales/order: Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/Order/InvoiceController.php<br>
Paste this code to newly overridden file:</p>
<p>{code type=php}&lt;?php require_once(&lsquo;Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/Order/InvoiceController.php&rsquo;);
class Namespace_Module_Sales_Order_InvoiceController extends Mage_Adminhtml_Sales_Order_InvoiceController
{

*/</p>
<pre><code>public function saveAction()

-&gt;setCurPage(1);</p>
<p>$invLastIncrId = $invoiceLast-&gt;getFirstItem()-&gt;getIncrementId();<br>
$invNewIncrId = (int)$invLastIncrId + 1; //incrementing by 1<br>
$shipment-&gt;setInvoiceId($invNewIncrId); //setting data for our sales_flat_shipment table column invoice_id</p>
<p>$shipment-&gt;setEmailSent($invoice-&gt;getEmailSent());<br>
$transactionSave-&gt;addObject($shipment);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
$transactionSave-&gt;save();</p>
<p>if (!empty($data[‘do_shipment’]) || (int) $invoice-&gt;getOrder()-&gt;getForcedDoShipmentWithInvoice()) {<br>

      <title>Magento: Adding column to sales_flat_order_item, sales_flat_invoice_item and sales_flat_shipment_item</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to add column to some table before it gets save in Magento. Example, Magento doesn’t save regular price of product when an order is placed, it only saves the selling price. So if your product have some special price in it, then Magento only saves it’s special price when an order is placed, so there is no track of regular price of that product in order item table. Same it goes to invoice item and shipment item. When creating invoice and shipment, Magento doesn’t have any track on the regular price of invoiced item’s and shipment item’s regular price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you want to add column to some table before it gets save in Magento. Example, Magento doesn’t save regular price of product when an order is placed, it only saves the selling price. So if your product have some special price in it, then Magento only saves it’s special price when an order is placed, so there is no track of regular price of that product in order item table. Same it goes to invoice item and shipment item. When creating invoice and shipment, Magento doesn’t have any track on the regular price of invoiced item’s and shipment item’s regular price.</p>
<p>So here I show you how you will add a column “product_mrp” in each of 3 tables and update the information without firing any query!</p>
<p>First of all, make an installer script in your module that will alter these three tables and add column “product_mrp” or any of your choice.</p>
<p>{code type=php}&lt;?php $installer = $this;</p>
<p>$installer-?&gt;
startSetup();</p>
<p>$installer-&gt;run(”<br>
ALTER TABLE sales_flat_order_item ADD COLUMN product_mrp DECIMAL(12,4) NULL;<br>
ALTER TABLE sales_flat_invoice_item ADD COLUMN product_mrp DECIMAL(12,4) NULL;<br>
ALTER TABLE sales_flat_shipment_item ADD COLUMN product_mrp DECIMAL(12,4) NULL;<br>
“);</p>
<p>$installer-&gt;endSetup();</p>
<p>?&gt;{/code}</p>
<p>After this is executed, you will find your columns added at the end of your tables.<br>
Now we will catch the event before order is placed, before invoice is created and before shipment is saved.</p>
<p><strong>config.xml</strong><br>
{code type=xml}&lt;sales_order_place_before&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;adding_product_mrp_order&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->singleton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Namespace_Module_Model_Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

&lt;/sales_order_place_before&gt;</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->singleton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Namespace_Module_Model_Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

&lt;/sales_order_invoice_save_before&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;sales_order_shipment_save_before&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;adding_product_mrp_shipment&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->singleton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Namespace_Module_Model_Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>

&lt;/adding_product_mrp_shipment&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;/sales_order_shipment_save_before&gt;{/code}</p>
<p>Now comes the Observer part that will add our column data before data is actually saved in table.</p>
<p><strong>Observer.php</strong><br>
{code type=php}public function saveProductMrpInOrder(Varien_Event_Observer $observer) {<br>
$order = $observer-&gt;getEvent()-&gt;getOrder();<br>
foreach($order-&gt;getAllItems() as $item) {<br>
$price = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($item-&gt;getId())-&gt;getPrice();<br>
$item-&gt;setProductMrp($price);<br>
}<br>
return $this;<br>
}</p>
<p>public function saveProductMrpInInvoice(Varien_Event_Observer $observer) {<br>
$invoice = $observer-&gt;getEvent()-&gt;getInvoice();<br>
foreach($invoice-&gt;getAllItems() as $item) {<br>
$price = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($item-&gt;getProductId())-&gt;getPrice();<br>
$item-&gt;setProductMrp($price);<br>
}<br>
return $this;<br>
}</p>
<p>public function saveProductMrpInShipment(Varien_Event_Observer $observer)<br>
{<br>
$shipment = $observer-&gt;getEvent()-&gt;getShipment();<br>
foreach($shipment-&gt;getAllItems() as $item) {<br>
$product = Mage::getModel(‘catalog/product’)-&gt;load($item-&gt;getProductId());<br>
$price = $product-&gt;getPrice();<br>
$item-&gt;product_mrp = $price;<br>
}<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now clear the cache, and place order and create it’s invoice and shipment. You will find the regular price of each of your products in all these three useful tables and hence you can track the original price information even if your product’s price has been changed afterwards.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After banging my head on my desk trying to get the records with NULL values with Magento ORM, it was found that writing&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$collection-&amp;gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, ‘null’)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$collection-&amp;gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, array(‘is’ =&amp;gt; ‘null’)){/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;will check for any blank values like this: &lt;em&gt;WHERE somefield = ”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to fetch records that have NULL values in Magento style, you need to write as following:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}$collection-&amp;gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, array(‘null’=&amp;gt;’null’){/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;will check like &lt;em&gt;WHERE somefield = null&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After banging my head on my desk trying to get the records with NULL values with Magento ORM, it was found that writing<br>
{code type=php}$collection-&gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, ‘null’)<br>
$collection-&gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, array(‘is’ =&gt; ‘null’)){/code}<br>
will check for any blank values like this: <em>WHERE somefield = ”</em></p>
<p>So if you want to fetch records that have NULL values in Magento style, you need to write as following:<br>
{code type=php}$collection-&gt;addAttributeToFilter(‘somefield’, array(‘null’=&gt;’null’){/code}<br>
will check like <em>WHERE somefield = null</em></p>
<p>Hope this saves someone’s time!</p>

      <title>Magento: Wrong count in admin Grid when using GROUP BY clause, overriding lib module</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have noticed or not, in version 1.5 of Magento when you use GROUP BY clause in any Grid.php file in admin, the count always display wrong. Many times it displays 1 even if there are hundreds of records. Due to this your pagination also doesn’t work. This is a bug in Magento. Your getSize() always returns wrong count whereas total records in grid are proper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you need to edit one of your core file. As it’s not a good practice to edit core file, we will here override the core file.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Overriding LIB module&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>To fix this, you need to edit one of your core file. As it’s not a good practice to edit core file, we will here override the core file.<br>
Overriding LIB module</p>
<p>Copy Db.php file from magento / lib / Varien / Data / Collection / Db.php<br>
Paste it to your local directory so the resultant folder structure would look like this:<br>
magento / app / code / local / Varien / Data / Collection / Db.php</p>
<p>Now open this file to edit and replace getSelectCountSql function with below one<br>
{code type=php} public function getSelectCountSql()<br>
{<br>
$this-&gt;_renderFilters();</p>
<p>$countSelect = clone $this-&gt;getSelect();<br>
$countSelect-&gt;reset(Zend_Db_Select::ORDER);<br>
$countSelect-&gt;reset(Zend_Db_Select::LIMIT_COUNT);<br>
$countSelect-&gt;reset(Zend_Db_Select::LIMIT_OFFSET);<br>
$countSelect-&gt;reset(Zend_Db_Select::COLUMNS);</p>
<p>if(count($this-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::GROUP)) &gt; 0) {<br>
$countSelect-&gt;reset(Zend_Db_Select::GROUP);<br>
$countSelect-&gt;distinct(true);<br>
$group = $this-&gt;getSelect()-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::GROUP);<br>
$countSelect-&gt;columns(“COUNT(DISTINCT “.implode(“, “, $group).”)”);<br>
} else {<br>
$countSelect-&gt;columns(‘COUNT(*)’);<br>
}<br>
return $countSelect;<br>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want your Magento website to show in maintenance mode, you will have to do two things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1. Create a file name &lt;strong&gt;maintenance.flag&lt;/strong&gt; in your magento root directory. Contents under this file doesn’t matter, you can keep it empty.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;2. Change the maintenance file (located in &lt;strong&gt;magento root -&amp;gt; errors -&amp;gt; default&lt;/strong&gt; directory) to show proper message when user visits your website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your Magento website have feature where guest user can place an order without registering themself in your site, you can add them as a customer in your database. It helps in grouping the orders w.r.t email address in backend sales order. The only condition is that he should provide his email address while placing an order, which is quite obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here is a snippet of code you can insert where you are asking user to enter his email address. Just check if the user is already not registered in your site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So here is a snippet of code you can insert where you are asking user to enter his email address. Just check if the user is already not registered in your site.</p>
<p>{code type=php}$e = $email; //provided by guest user</p>

$websiteId = Mage::app()-&gt;getWebsite()-&gt;getId();</p>

$customerObj-&gt;website_id = $websiteId;<br>
$customerObj-&gt;setStore($store);</p>

$pwd = uniqid($prefix);</p>
<p>$session = Mage::getSingleton(‘checkout/session’);<br>

$customerObj-&gt;setFirstname(‘Guest’);<br>
$customerObj-&gt;setLastname(‘Guest’);<br>
$customerObj-&gt;setPassword($pwd);<br>
$customerObj-&gt;save();<br>
$customerObj-&gt;sendNewAccountEmail(‘confirmed’); //auto confirmed<br>
{/code}</p>
<p>UPDATE: It depends where you want to keep this functionality on your site. I have put it in saveShippingMethodAction() function of Mage/Checkout/controllers/OnepageController.php file after extending. Don’t forget, this code should only be run if customer is guest.</p>

      <title>Magento: Getting back shopping cart items after order fails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s very awkward if users place an order in your website and by chance the order fails, from end user side or some technical glitch, shopping cart becomes empty. User have to again add items in cart and go through the process which becomes tedious and may be changing their mind to shop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here’s a code that does the trick and preserves shopping cart content even if order gets failed.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Open your file where you’re handling your order failure action in frontend. (generally &lt;strong&gt;Mage/Checkout/controllers/OnepageController.php&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}public function failureAction()&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$lastQuoteId = $this-&amp;gt;getOnepage()-&amp;gt;getCheckout()-&amp;gt;getLastQuoteId();&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$lastOrderId = $this-&amp;gt;getOnepage()-&amp;gt;getCheckout()-&amp;gt;getLastOrderId();&lt;/p&gt;</description>

User have to again add items in cart and go through the process which becomes tedious and may be changing their mind to shop.</p>
<p>So here’s a code that does the trick and preserves shopping cart content even if order gets failed.<br>
Open your file where you’re handling your order failure action in frontend. (generally <strong>Mage/Checkout/controllers/OnepageController.php</strong>)<br>
{code type=php}public function failureAction()<br>
{<br>
$lastQuoteId = $this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getCheckout()-&gt;getLastQuoteId();<br>
$lastOrderId = $this-&gt;getOnepage()-&gt;getCheckout()-&gt;getLastOrderId();</p>
<p>if ($lastQuoteId &amp;&amp; $lastOrderId) {<br>
$orderModel = Mage::getModel(‘sales/order’)-&gt;load($lastOrderId);<br>
if($orderModel-&gt;canCancel()) {</p>
<p>$quote = Mage::getModel(‘sales/quote’)-&gt;load($lastQuoteId);<br>
$quote-&gt;setIsActive(true)-&gt;save();</p>
<p>$orderModel-&gt;cancel();<br>
$orderModel-&gt;setStatus(‘canceled’);<br>
$orderModel-&gt;save();</p>
<p>Mage::getSingleton(‘core/session’)-&gt;setFailureMsg(‘order_failed’);<br>
Mage::getSingleton(‘checkout/session’)-&gt;setFirstTimeChk(‘0’);<br>
$this-&gt;_redirect(‘kcheckout/index/payment’, array(“_forced_secure” =&gt; true));<br>
return;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
if (!$lastQuoteId || !$lastOrderId) {<br>
$this-&gt;_redirect(‘checkout/cart’, array(“_forced_secure” =&gt; true));<br>
return;<br>
}</p>
<p>$this-&gt;loadLayout();<br>
$this-&gt;renderLayout();<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Be noted here that we don’t have here onepage checkout so we’re redirecting user to payment page after restoring the cart. You can redirect user to any page as per your need after the cart is restored and previous order is cancelled.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what if you want to do invoice and shipment with just one click in your website admin? Yes, Magento allows you to integrate both these in one step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit your module’s config.xml and Observer.php for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;config.xml&lt;/strong&gt; snippet:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=xml}&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;lt;sales_order_place_after&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;lt;namespace_module&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;singleton&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Namespace_Module_Model_Observer&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;doForceInvoiceWithShipment&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;lt;/namespace_module&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;lt;/sales_order_place_after&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Every time a order is placed, frontend as well as backend, your observer method will be called which will force invoice and shipment to show in one button in Manage Orders for particular order at backend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered what if you want to do invoice and shipment with just one click in your website admin? Yes, Magento allows you to integrate both these in one step.</p>
<p>Edit your module’s config.xml and Observer.php for this to happen.</p>
<p><strong>config.xml</strong> snippet:<br>
{code type=xml}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;sales_order_place_after&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;namespace_module&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->singleton<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Namespace_Module_Model_Observer<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->doForceInvoiceWithShipment<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;/namespace_module&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
&lt;/sales_order_place_after&gt;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->{/code}<br>
Every time a order is placed, frontend as well as backend, your observer method will be called which will force invoice and shipment to show in one button in Manage Orders for particular order at backend.</p>
<p><strong>Observer.php</strong> snippet:<br>
{code type=php}public function doForceInvoiceWithShipment($observer) {<br>
$order = $observer-&gt;getOrder();<br>
$orderId = $order-&gt;getIncrementId();<br>
Mage::getModel(‘sales/order’)-&gt;loadByIncrementId($orderId)-&gt;setForcedDoShipmentWithInvoice(true)-&gt;save();<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>Now you can place a order and check at backend under Sales-&gt;Orders clicking on latest order to see “Invoice &amp; Ship” button integrated rather than “Invoice” and “Ship” button separated.</p>

Before proceeding backup all your important data (contacts, messages, etc..) so that if something goes wrong in between, you are on your safer side. So here are the steps to follow:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have purchased Samsung galaxy fit S5670 mobile phone, you must have noticed that it has very short battery life. Also you may have experienced sudden switch off of your mobile and weird behavior. This is due to some bugs in Android OS version 2.2 (froyo).</p>
<p>To fix this, you will have to upgrade your android OS from 2.2 to 2.3.4 version which will increase your battery life to some extent. Before proceeding backup all your important data (contacts, messages, etc..) so that if something goes wrong in between, you are on your safer side. So here are the steps to follow:</p>
<p>1. Download <a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/mjuSJQDG/odin_multi_downloader_v438.html">ODIN Multi-downloader v4.38</a> – 444 KB<br>
2. Download <a href="http://hotfile.com/dl/120514743/bf7c5b1/S5670XXKPI.rar.html">Gingerbread Firmware</a> – 113 MB<br>
3. Turn off you samsung mobile phone<br>
4. Extract S5670XXKPI and run ODIN on your PC<br>
5. Select OPS file: BENI_v1.0.ops (from the extracted folder S5670XXKPI)<br>
– Click BOOT button and select: APBOOT_S5670xxxxx_CL913243_REV01_user_low_true.tar.md5<br>
– Click Phone button and select: MODEM_S5670xxxxx_CL913243_REV01.tar.md5<br>
– Click PDA button and select: CODE_S5670xxxxx_CL913243_REV01_user_low_true.tar.md5<br>
– Click CSC button and select: CSC_S5670xxxxxx_CL913243_REV01_user_low_true.tar.md5<br>
6. Turn your phone off. Switch it ON in downloading mode by pressing MIDDLE KEY + VOLUME DOWN + POWER buttons<br>
7. Connect USB cable and check ODIN should read the COM port number. You will see yellow color box.<br>
8. Now click Start. Upgrade begins. Don’t interrupt anything until you see PASS in your ODIN software.</p>
<p>Once you are done with the upgrade process, your mobile will start in some different language (Russian). To change the language to English (US) click on Menu -&gt; Settings Icon -&gt; A icon -&gt; Click First option -&gt; Scroll down to English (US).</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

      <title>Magento: Show only specific attributes in layered navigation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011-07-10-magento-show-only-specific-attributes-in-layered-navigation/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011-07-10-magento-show-only-specific-attributes-in-layered-navigation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Magento, if you have lots of attributes (e.g. Type, Size, Price, Color, etc.) defined for categories, all are shown in the layered navigation on the left side. This may be sometimes annoying as they may break the website design. It is possible to disable the desired attributes from displaying on frontend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution is, go to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;– Magento Backend -&amp;gt; Catalog Tab -&amp;gt; Attributes -&amp;gt; Manage Attributes&lt;br&gt;&#xA;– Click the attributes you do not want to display in layered navigation&lt;br&gt;&#xA;– Select NO where it says “Use in Layered Navigation”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;– Save&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Magento: Can&amp;#8217;t login/add items in Chrome and IE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: In Chrome and IE, user as well as admin are unable to login as well as add items to cart. In Firefox, everything works fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: This is due to the cookie problem, not in browser but in Magento itself. In Magento, by default cookie’s lifetime is set to 3600 (1 hour). But if the end users computer time runs ahead of server’s time, cookies will not get set for magento frontend as well as backend. For example, end user’s computer time is 1 hour forward than server’s time, that means the cookie (holding user’s session id) will expire as soon as user logs in or tries to add an item.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>To solve this, set cookie’s lifetime to 86400 (1 day) instead of 1 hour and everything will work as expected. You can also set cookie lifetime to 0, so that cookie will only expire when the user’s browser is closed.</p>
<p>Go to: Magento backend -&gt; Sytem -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Web -&gt; Session and Cookie Management<br>
Set cookie lifetime to 86400 and save. Everything will work as expected now.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important part in magento development is to check whether customer is logged in or not in the system. So that you can show specific features and extra privileges to your customers. There are many things that are restricted to the guests, while members can see the special privilege things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also if the customer is not logged in, we can show a link like “Log in”; while for logged in customers, we can show link like “Log out”, “My account”, etc. This is already present in Magento, but we may want to add more features to our customers. So here is the code where you can check customer is logged in or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>At beginning, the task was the tough nut to crack, but then it was more interesting and honestly we loved it.</p>
<p>Magento is really far more different and complex than other frameworks, cms and commerce softwares.<br>
It has got the power to make a giant eCommerce website but beware, it is also too slow and resouce-hungry.<br>
It has everything you want during development, you just need to know from where and how to get and use it.</p>
<p>There were many things we learned through the process.</p>
<p>It has everything the magento website can have, from core module rewrites to EAV module.</p>
<p>Plenty of customization but no changes in core!</p>
<p>It was really a great experience and things in Magento are far more clear to us now.</p>

      <title>Override/Rewrite Magento core blocks and controllers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After spending many hours in rewriting block and controller of Magento core module, I finally came up with a solution.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Here I am going to rewrite block: &lt;strong&gt;Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Sales/Shipment/Grid.php&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and controller: &lt;strong&gt;Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/ShipmentController.php&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First you will need to make a xml file for your new module at app/etc/modules directory&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;CompanyName_Adminhtml.xml&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;{code type=php}&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, make folders in your app/code/local directory as follows:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;– CompanyName&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt; Block&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—&amp;gt; Sales&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—-&amp;gt; Shipment&lt;br&gt;&#xA;——&amp;gt; Grid.php&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt; controllers&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—&amp;gt; Sales&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—-&amp;gt; ShipmentController.php&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-&amp;gt; etc&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—&amp;gt; config.xml&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After spending many hours in rewriting block and controller of Magento core module, I finally came up with a solution.<br>
Here I am going to rewrite block: <strong>Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Sales/Shipment/Grid.php</strong><br>
and controller: <strong>Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/ShipmentController.php</strong></p>
<p>First you will need to make a xml file for your new module at app/etc/modules directory<br>
<strong>CompanyName_Adminhtml.xml</strong></p>
<p>{code type=php}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, make folders in your app/code/local directory as follows:<br>
– CompanyName<br>
-&gt; Block<br>
—&gt; Sales<br>
—-&gt; Shipment<br>
——&gt; Grid.php<br>
-&gt; controllers<br>
—&gt; Sales<br>
—-&gt; ShipmentController.php<br>
-&gt; etc<br>
—&gt; config.xml</p>
<p>In <strong>etc/config.xml</strong>, your code should look like below:</p>
<p>{code type=php}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>{/code}</p>
<p>In <strong>ShipmentController.php</strong>, you should start like this:</p>
<p>{code type=php}require_once(“Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Sales/ShipmentController.php”);<br>
class CompanyName_Adminhtml_Sales_ShipmentController extends Mage_Adminhtml_Sales_ShipmentController<br>
{<br>
//controller methods goes here..<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>require_once is necessary as magento is not going to load controllers as it does for blocks and models</p>
<p>In block <strong>Grid.php</strong>, start the file like below:<br>
{code type=php}class CompanyName_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Shipment_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Grid<br>
{<br>
// block methods goes here..<br>
}{/code}</p>
<p>That’s it! Now you should get your local Grid.php and ShipmentController.php loading instead of core’s.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 6th, 2011 I got email from magentocommerce that eBay agreed to acquire our darling magento. Whether it is a good news or bad news for the Magento developers? Without any proper documentation or helpful sources, we have fought enough to get our Magento development run flawless. It may be obvious that after eBay acquires Magento, there may be many changes in Magento world, like proper documentation with code examples, good community support (where we can expect working answers to our posted questions) for enterprise edition, leader in the eCommerce market, education of Magento and its training globally, any many more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Magento will be called as X.Commerce after eBay acquires it. eBay is already attached with Magento since 2010, when it became the magento’s outside investor. eBay saw a great scope of Magento and that is the reason it does not resist itself in acquiring this eCommerce web application giant.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After installing magento 1.5, I tried to login to the admin panel with correct username and password, but it does not let me in without any error message. This is due to cookie problem in magento and can be fixed as below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open this file in your favorite editor: &lt;strong&gt;app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Session/Abstract/Varien.php&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comment lines that says like (probably line number 81 to 83)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;getDomain(),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;isSecure(),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;getHttponly()&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{code type=php}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;//$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;getDomain(),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;//$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;isSecure(),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;//$this-&amp;gt;getCookie()-&amp;gt;getHttponly()&lt;br&gt;&#xA;{/code}&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now you could login to your admin panel without any problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
