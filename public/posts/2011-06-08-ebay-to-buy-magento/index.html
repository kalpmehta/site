  <p>On June 6th, 2011 I got email from magentocommerce that eBay agreed to acquire our darling magento. Whether it is a good news or bad news for the Magento developers? Without any proper documentation or helpful sources, we have fought enough to get our Magento development run flawless. It may be obvious that after eBay acquires Magento, there may be many changes in Magento world, like proper documentation with code examples, good community support (where we can expect working answers to our posted questions) for enterprise edition, leader in the eCommerce market, education of Magento and its training globally, any many more.</p>
<p>Magento will be called as X.Commerce after eBay acquires it. eBay is already attached with Magento since 2010, when it became the magento’s outside investor. eBay saw a great scope of Magento and that is the reason it does not resist itself in acquiring this eCommerce web application giant.</p>
