If you see your images in product detail page but don’t see it in category page, it’s because your product have images (image attribute filled) but not small_image and thumbnail which are required to display on category page.

  <p><strong>Set product image as small image and thumbnail programatically</strong></p>
<p>If you see your images in product detail page but don’t see it in category page, it’s because your product have images (image attribute filled) but not <em>small_image</em> and <em>thumbnail</em> which are required to display on category page. If there are only few products you want to set small_image and thumbnail, then it’s easy to go to <em>Manage Products &gt; Individual Product &gt; Images tab &gt; Set small image and thumbnail radio button</em>. But when it comes to hundreds/thousands of products, you better want it programatically way.</p>
<p>Make a file in your Magento root and place the below code in it. Then run that file and you have just copied your Product Image to small image and thumbnail as well!</p>
<p>{code type=php}&lt;?php ini_set(&lsquo;display_errors&rsquo;,1);
require &lsquo;app/Mage.php&rsquo;;
Mage::app();</p>
<p>$products = Mage::getModel(&lsquo;catalog/product&rsquo;)-?&gt;
getCollection()-&gt;addAttributeToSelect(‘*’);<br>
foreach ($products as $product) {<br>
if (!$product-&gt;hasImage()) continue;<br>
if (!$product-&gt;hasSmallImage()) $product-&gt;setSmallImage($product-&gt;getImage());<br>
if (!$product-&gt;hasThumbnail()) $product-&gt;setThumbnail($product-&gt;getImage());<br>
$product-&gt;save();<br>
}<br>
echo ‘Finished!’;<br>
?&gt;{/code}</p>
