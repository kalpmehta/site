<p>At beginning, the task was the tough nut to crack, but then it was more interesting and honestly we loved it.</p>
<p>Magento is really far more different and complex than other frameworks, cms and commerce softwares.<br>
It has got the power to make a giant eCommerce website but beware, it is also too slow and resouce-hungry.<br>
It has everything you want during development, you just need to know from where and how to get and use it.</p>
<p>There were many things we learned through the process.</p>
<p>It has everything the magento website can have, from core module rewrites to EAV module.</p>
<p>Plenty of customization but no changes in core!</p>
<p>It was really a great experience and things in Magento are far more clear to us now.</p>

      <title>eBay to buy Magento</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 6th, 2011 I got email from magentocommerce that eBay agreed to acquire our darling magento. Whether it is a good news or bad news for the Magento developers? Without any proper documentation or helpful sources, we have fought enough to get our Magento development run flawless. It may be obvious that after eBay acquires Magento, there may be many changes in Magento world, like proper documentation with code examples, good community support (where we can expect working answers to our posted questions) for enterprise edition, leader in the eCommerce market, education of Magento and its training globally, any many more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Magento will be called as X.Commerce after eBay acquires it. eBay is already attached with Magento since 2010, when it became the magento’s outside investor. eBay saw a great scope of Magento and that is the reason it does not resist itself in acquiring this eCommerce web application giant.</p>
